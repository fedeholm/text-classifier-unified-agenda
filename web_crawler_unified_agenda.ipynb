A number of time/area closures or gear-restricted areas have been implemented over the years through various rulemakings, limiting fishing for Atlantic highly migratory species in those areas for a variety of reasons including reducing bycatch. These time/area closures have been implemented in consultation with the HMS Advisory Panel to protect species consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (e.g., to reduce bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off the east coast of Florida), the Endangered Species Act (e.g., to protect sea turtles in the North Atlantic), and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (e.g., to protect spawning bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico). Fishery-dependent data supports effective fisheries management, and areas that restrict fishing effort often have a commensurate decrease in fishery-dependent data collection. Programs to facilitate research and data collection, such as those that would be covered by this rulemaking, could assess the efficacy of closed areas, improve sustainable management of highly migratory species, and may provide benefits to commercial and recreational fishermen.'\n",

This action would require trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear vessels with Federal Fishing Permits (FFP) that fish in state waters during the parallel seasons to have an appropriate license issued through the Federal License Limitation Program (LLP) that corresponds to the license they are required to have to participate in the Pacific cod fishery in Federal waters.  Through their FFP, those vessels would also be required to adhere to Federal seasonal closures and other management measures for their sector when participating in the parallel seasons.  Additionally, the proposed regulations would limit the period of time in which a vessel may relinquish its FFP, and then reapply for a new FFP.  Lengthening the amount of time that must pass before a person can reapply for an FFP would make it more difficult to circumvent the proposed regulation by temporarily surrendering the FFP.'\n",

The rule also makes one minor technical correction in subpart L, which pertains to Public Housing. In 2017, HUD published a final rule, amending its lead-based paint regulations to reduce blood lead levels in children under age six (6) who reside in federally-owned or -assisted pre-1978 housing. After publication of the final rule, HUD received feedback recommending that the rule’s reporting requirements, specifically those for residential properties receiving project-based assistance and housing occupied by families receiving tenant-based rental assistance, should be streamlined to ensure that the reporting process conformed to best practices and reflected existing relationships among the interested parties. Through this interim final rule, HUD streamlines the reporting process to reflect best or existing practices, and to reduce the burden on owners.

These proposed regulations will rectify a situation where DEA’s ability to strike an appropriate balance between ensuring the availability of controlled substances to industry and the risk to public health and safety has been hindered and resulted in an overproduction of controlled substances inventories available for diversion.'\n",

MSHA’s existing coal mine standards evaluate miners’ exposure to quartz in relation to the respirable dust standard. When respirable coal mine dust samples are analyzed for quartz and exceed 0.1 mg/m3 (100 micrograms per cubic meter of air or µg/m3), the Agency reduces the applicable respirable dust standard for sections of the mine represented by the sample data.  MSHA will publish a proposed rule to address miners' exposure to respirable quartz.'\n",

The Department's statute is modeled after a similar statute granting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the authority to regulate unfair or deceptive practices.  Using the FTC's policy statements as a guide, the Department has found a practice to be unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial harm, the harm cannot reasonably be avoided, and the harm is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.  Likewise, the Department has found a practice to be deceptive if it misleads or is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances with respect to a material issue (one that is likely to affect the consumer's decision with regard to a product or service).  This rulemaking would codify the Department's existing interpretation of \"unfair or deceptive practice,\" and seek comment on any whether changes are needed.  The rulemaking would also require the Department to articulate in future enforcement orders the basis for concluding that a practice is unfair or deceptive where no existing regulation governs the practice in question, state the basis for its conclusion that a practice is unfair or deceptive when it issues discretionary aviation consumer protection regulations, and apply formal hearing procedures for discretionary aviation consumer protection rulemakings.  In addition, this rulemaking would codify the longstanding practice of the Department to offer airlines and ticket agents the opportunity to be heard and present relevant evidence before any determination is made on how to resolve a matter involving a potential unfair or deceptive practice.'\n",

Harmonization enhances safety, facilitates compliance, and improves the efficiency of the global transportation system by minimizing the regulatory burden on the public thus promoting trade. After a thorough review of the provisions recently adopted by various international regulatory bodies, PHMSA has identified areas in the HMR in which harmonization with international regulations will provide an enhanced level of safety, an economic benefit, or in many instances both increased safety and economic benefits. As a result, this rulemaking would amend the HMR, where appropriate, to maintain alignment with international standards that will become effective as of January 1, 2021, and consequently facilitate the safe global trade of hazardous materials. Proposals in this rulemaking action would include, but are not limited to: New classification and packaging for infectious waste of Category A; Updates to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) cylinder manufacturing and testing standards, and addition of two new entries to the organic peroxides table; Expansion of existing options to transport large robust articles (i.e., refrigerating machines) unpackaged on pallets, in crates, or in appropriate overpacks to include other large robust articles containing gases; and Incorporation by reference of various international standards and regulations, including the latest editions of the UN Model Regulations, the IMDG Code, the ICAO Technical Instructions, and ISO technical standards applicable to cylinders.'\n",

As a preliminary step, the EPA intends to publish an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit data and information regarding manufacturers of PFAS and the presence and treatment of PFAS in discharges from this industrial category. The EPA also intends to request information regarding PFAS formulators, which are facilities that produce a variety of PFAS products and materials from PFAS feedstocks. The EPA was able to obtain only limited data regarding formulators through publicly available sources, and additional information would inform the Agency’s consideration of discharges from PFAS formulators and the need for updated ELGs for these facilities.

Also, the \"receiver pays\" approach that was generally applicable to domestic shipments in that final rule was not suitable in the export context, as the receiver of exported wastes is a foreign entity. Thus, in this action we are considering a regulatory change to address which entity involved in the export supply chain is best suited to (1) submit export manifests to EPA and (2) pay the requisite user fee for the processing of export manifests so that exported wastes may be included in the scope of the e-Manifest system. Additionally, we are considering revisions to the manifest forms so that manifest data for import and export shipments can be recorded more clearly on them. This rule also considers revisions to the export and import shipment movement document related requirements to more closely link the manifest data with the movement document data, and various technical corrections and conforming amendments to import and export requirements. This action addresses several manifest-related reports that are required when there are specific manifested waste shipment problems. The current regulations require the following reports to be submitted in writing: (1) an Exception Report from generators when a signed manifest confirming the receipt of wastes by the designated facility is overdue; (2) a Discrepancy Report from the designated receiving facility when the waste received differs significantly in quantity or type from the waste that the generator indicated was shipped, and (3) an Unmanifested Waste Report from a receiving facility when a shipment arrives at the receiving facility that was not accompanied by a manifest, but should have been tracked with a manifest required under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Since much of the manifest information that is the basis for these separate reports will be available and trackable in e-Manifest, this action considers regulatory changes to the regulations for the manifested related reports so that they can be transmitted electronically and more efficiently in e-Manifest rather than as separate, written reports. This action also considers applicable revisions to the federal manifest regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) so that they align with the RCRA manifest regulations and the e-Manifest Program.

The HAP list includes substances that are air pollutants, and for which emissions, ambient concentrations, bioaccumulation or deposition of the substance are known or reasonably anticipated to cause adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. The CAA requires EPA to consider petitions to add or remove substances from the HAP list. EPA reviews a petition to determine whether it provides adequate data and can be determined complete. If EPA decides that information is not adequate, the Administrator may use any authority available to them to acquire such information. If the petition is determined complete or EPA acquires adequate information through other means of its authority, EPA must, within 18 months, technically review the petition and then either grant or deny the petition. On September 30, 2019, the Dow Chemical Company submitted a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to remove 2-butoxyethyl benzoate (2-BEB) from the category of glycol ethers in the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) under section 112(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(3). Dow views 2-BEB as a potential replacement for ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) and some other chemicals for specific applications. EGBE was delisted as a HAP by EPA on November 29, 2004. The EPA completed the initial review of the petition and found that it was insufficient. The EPA provided the petitioner with a list of additional information to provide and is awaiting receipt of this information. Once it receives and reviews the additional information, the EPA will again determine if the petition is complete based on the updated information. If it is deemed complete, the EPA will introduce a notice that acknowledges receipt of a complete petition, initiates the 18-month window for the EPA to rule on the petition per CAA section 112(b), and solicits comments on the petition to remove 2-BEB from the CAA section 112(b)(3) HAP list.'\n",

The changes will enable the Commission to continue to fulfill its statutory obligations under sections 201 and 210 of PURPA. The key changes to the regulations include the following: First, the final rule grants states the flexibility to require that energy rates (but not capacity rates) in QF power sales contracts and other legally enforceable obligations vary in accordance with changes in the purchasing electric utility’s as-available avoided costs at the time the energy is delivered. Second, the final rule grants states flexibility to allow QFs to have a fixed energy rate, which can be based on projected energy prices during the term of the QF’s contract based on the anticipated dates of delivery. Third, the final rule grants states flexibility to set \"as-available\" QF energy rates based on the locational marginal price (LMP) established in organized electric markets. With respect to QFs selling to electric utilities located outside of the organized electric markets, the final rule provides states the option to set as-available energy avoided cost rates either at competitive prices from liquid market hubs or calculated from a formula based on natural gas price indices and specified heat rates, provided that the states first determine that such prices represent the purchasing electric utilities’ avoided costs. Fourth, the final rule provides states the flexibility to set energy and capacity rates pursuant to a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to transparent and non-discriminatory procedures. Fifth, the final rule modifies the Commission’s \"one-mile rule\" for determining whether affiliated small power production facilities are considered to be at the same site for purposes of determining whether a small power production facility meets the statutory 80 MW limit. Sixth, the final rule allows electric utilities, state regulatory authorities, and other interested parties to challenge an initial self-certification or self-recertification by filing a protest. Seventh, the final rule revises the Commission’s regulations which provide for the termination of an electric utility’s obligation to purchase from a QF with nondiscriminatory access to certain markets, updating the threshold for small power production facilities (but not cogeneration facilities) to 5 MW. Finally, the final rule clarifies that a QF must demonstrate commercial viability and a financial commitment to construct its facility pursuant to objective and reasonable state-determined criteria before the QF is entitled to a contract or legally enforceable obligation (Docket Nos. RM19-15-000 and AD16-16-000).'\n",

However, prior to section 1114 of the FY 2020 NDAA, WTA and RITA allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5724b were available only to employees “transferred” in the interest of the Government from one official station or agency to another for permanent duty. Accordingly, this proposed rule updates the FTR to reflect the statutory expansion of eligibility for WTA and RITA to include, among others, individuals not previously eligible for WTA and RITA e.g., new appointees including political appointees, employees returning from an overseas assignment for the purpose of separation from Government service, Senior Executive Service employees eligible for “last move home” entitlements, and those assigned under the Government Employees Training Act. The proposed rule will also correct certain mandatory and discretionary relocation entitlements depending on an individual’s type of movement.'\n",

Section 880 of the NDAA also amends 15 U.S.C. sections (j) and (p), which require that SBA modify the Policy Directive to require procurement center representatives (as described at 15 U.S.C. section 644(l)) to consult with personnel from participating agencies to assist SBCs participating in the SBIR/STTR programs, and particularly with Phase III.  Section 881 of the NDAA modifies 15 U.S.C. section 638(q), and adds cybersecurity technical assistance as one of the services that small businesses participating in the SBIR/STTR programs may fund with technical and business assistance funding, as detailed in that section. Finally, section 884 of the NDAA authorizes the Department of Defense to establish and administer the Defense Investment Pilot Program, which expands eligibility for SBIR/STTR awards to entities that are owned exclusively by multiple U.S.-owned venture capital operating companies (VCOCs), hedge funds (HFs), or private equity firms (PEFs). Under this pilot program, eligibility is also expanded to entities that are majority owned by multiple U.S.-owned VCOCs, HFs, and PEFs, if the minority foreign ownership is limited to members of the national technology and industrial base, as defined at 10 U.S.C. section 2500.
