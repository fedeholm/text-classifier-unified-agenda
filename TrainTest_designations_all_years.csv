Regulatory,"This rulemaking would amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. This action would heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"APHIS is proposing to revise its national Brucellosis eradication program. Currently, the program assigns statuses to States based on the prevalence of brucellosis within the State. The current statuses in the classification system are, from highest to lowest: Class Free, Class A, and Class B. APHIS is proposing a new classification system in which States would be assigned statuses based on whether a State is consistent or inconsistent with regard to standards contained in a Program Standards document regarding surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and affected herd management. In addition, APHIS proposes to remove the list of brucellosis State classifications for both the cattle and bison and swine programs from the CFR and move the list to the APHIS website, and to revise conditions for interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine to reflect the new State classification system. Finally, APHIS is proposing to align vaccination and branding requirements in the regulations with current operational practices.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the importation of live dogs by requiring all live dogs imported into the United States for resale purposes to be microchipped for permanent identification, and to require importers to procure a microchip reader and make it available to port-of-entry officials as requested. This action would also add microchipping as one of three identification options for dogs and cats used by dealers, exhibitors and research facilities.  In addition, APHIS is proposing to require a verifiable signature on the health certificate and rabies certificate accompanying imported live dogs, an endorsement of the health certificate by a government official in the country of origin, and the mandatory use of forms provided by APHIS.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"This action proposes establishing a standardized formula model for U.S. Grain Standards Act supervision fee adjustments. This will not be a new fee but only a revision in the formula. This will allow the fee and or user fee account to be in alignment with other AMS and FGIS user fee accounts, such as providing for an annual review of the operating reserve. AMS would publish in the Federal Register annually to notify the public of the fee adjustments and then post the updated fees on the AMS website.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"FSIS is proposing to revise the regulations prescribing the statistical methods to be used in measuring the performance of chemistry laboratories in its voluntary Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP) and to expand the program to include pathogen testing.

Deregulatory,"The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to expand the categories of meat and poultry product labels that it will deem generically approved and thus not required to be submitted to FSIS. These reforms will reduce the regulatory burden on producers seeking to bring products to market, as well as the Agency costs expended to evaluate the labels. FSIS is proposing to make these changes by revising its labeling regulations in 9 CFR part 412.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations to permit young chicken slaughter establishments operating under the NPIS to operate at line speeds up to 175 bpm if certain criteria are met. Young chicken NPIS establishments approved to operate at a maximum line speed of 175 bpm would need to continue to meet these criteria to continue to operate at line speeds faster than 140 bpm and up to 175 bpm. The proposed amendments would allow certain young chicken establishments to slaughter birds more efficiently while continuing to ensure food safety and effective online carcass inspection.,Fall_2020
Regulatory,"The Food Safety and Inspection Service is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection, poultry product, and egg regulations to require establishments that have an Internet connection to provide FSIS access to it for the purposes of conducting and recording inspection verification activities.  Internet service is essential to FSIS personnel for the inspection of meat, poultry, and egg products, given the need to fully employ the FSIS Public Health Information System (PHIS). PHIS assigns inspectors tasks to verify the establishment meets regulatory requirements and to respond to public health incidents promptly.  Inspectors also enter their activities in PHIS.  FSIS views Internet service as a necessary utility, like lighting, heating, and laundry services, that should be provided by establishments as a regulatory condition of receiving inspection.  Similar to the provision that small plants requiring less than one full time inspector need not furnish facilities such as office space, lighting, heat, janitor services, and lockers, FSIS will not require establishments without Internet access to purchase the services or to upgrade services that are not sufficient for FSIS use.",Fall_2020

Section 322 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (the Act) requires the Secretary to establish procedures for the termination and disqualification of organizations participating in the Summer Food Service Program. This rule also establishes criteria for imposing fines against schools, school food authorities, or State agencies in CACFP as required by section 303 of the Act. Additionally, this rule seeks to clarify challenges identified through public comments on the proposed, CN Integrity Rule and through the request for information (RFI) on the SD process.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"The Forest Service proposes the amendment of its locatable mineral regulations to better reflect the needs of our national defense and economic prosperity. Recent issues and existing weaknesses in the current regulations have been identified, and updating regulations addressing these would allow the Forest Service to better implement its mining regulations. Specifically, the Forest Service is considering in this proposed rule to 1) expedite review and approval of certain proposed mineral operations; 2) increase consistency with the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) surface management regulations; and 3) increase consistency within the Forest Services nationwide regulation of mineral operations.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"Consistent with the Forest Service's statutory cost recovery duty, the proposed rule would update the processing and monitoring fee schedules for special uses based on the agency's current costs to process special use applications and monitor compliance with special use authorizations. Also consistent with the Forest Service's cost recovery statutes, the proposed rule would amend the Forest Service's cost recovery regulations to provide for charging processing fees for screening special use proposals before a special use application is accepted. Consistent with the Forest Service's cost recovery statutes, the proposed rule would also remove the current exemption in the Forest Service's cost recovery regulations for recreation special use applications and authorizations that require 50 hours or less to process or monitor, except those for recreation residences. Removing the exemption would treat these uses commensurate with lands special uses and would help address the agency's processing and monitoring backlog. Recreation residence applications and authorizations requiring 50 hours or less to process or monitor would not be charged cost recovery fees because they are already subject to an administrative fee of $1,200 under the Cabin Fee Act, 16 U.S.C. 6214, when recreation residence permits are transferred.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"Current Forest Service regulations at 36 CFR part 251, subpart B, govern the processing of special use applications and issuance of special use authorizations for uses of National Forest System (NFS) lands, including communications uses. Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2709.11, chapter 90, provides direction for communications uses and Chapter 30, provides direction for fee administration. These regulations and directives need to be updated consistent with newly enacted statutes that establish requirements for charging a new programmatic administrative fee for communications use authorizations.",Fall_2020

Deregulatory,"EDA is proposing to amend the regulations located at 13 CFR 300.3, 301.7, 301.8, 301.9, 303.3, 305.3, 306.3, 306.6, and 307.5. These regulations describe the process for applying for various EDA grants under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 and the evaluation and selection criteria EDA will apply when reviewing those applications. Portions of these regulations are more appropriately communicated to potential applicants through an EDA Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which specifically addresses the program requirements for applying for grants in a particular fiscal year that may change from year to year to reflect Administration priorities or changing economic circumstances. Moreover, those interested in the specific requirements of such grants generally know to review grants.gov for those requirements rather than the regulations. EDA proposes to retain those portions of these regulations that direct applicants to look to the NOFO for specific requirements and that establish certain procedural steps that require regulations (e.g., EDA does not accept appeals of denied applications and limits on indirect costs). Finally, EDA is proposing to amend the definitions section of the regulations to eliminate the definition of ""Regional Innovation Clusters or RICs."" The term is separately defined in 13 CFR 312.3. Eliminating the definition removes duplication while reducing the potential for confusion.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"The National Marine Fisheries Service published a final rule to list the Arctic ringed seal as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in December 2012. The ESA requires designation of critical habitat at the time a species is listed as threatened or endangered, or within one year of listing if critical habitat is not then determinable. This rulemaking would designate critical habitat for the Arctic ringed seal. The critical habitat designation would be in the northern Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas within the current range of the species.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"In response to recommendations by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, this rulemaking action proposes to cap and reduce individual and aggregate trap caps in the Offshore Area 3 lobster fishery and cap the number of permits a permit holder may have in nearshore Area 2. It also proposes to implement components of the Commission's Addendum XXVI to the American Lobster Management Plan. Among other things, the Addendum requires the lobster harvesting states to implement a trip-level reporting requirement with expanded data elements for all lobster fishermen in their respective jurisdictions, and recommends complementary action for Federal lobster permit holders. We propose to implement the mandatory trip-level harvester reporting requirement through this action. Finally, this action also proposes to make some minor administrative changes to the lobster trap transfer program, consider allowing the use of a substitute vessel to tend lobster gear in certain circumstances, and will remove some outdated text from the Federal lobster regulation at 50 CFR 697.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"This proposed rule will make conforming amendments to regulations implementing the various statutes amended by the Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-81). The Act amends several regional fishery management organization implementing statutes as well as the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act. It also provides authority to implement two new international agreements under the Antigua Convention, which amends the Convention for the establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (Port State Measures Agreement), which restricts the entry into U.S. ports by foreign fishing vessels that are known to be or are suspected of engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. This proposed rule will also implement the Port State Measures Agreement. To that end, this proposed rule will require the collection of certain information from foreign fishing vessels requesting permission to use U.S. ports. It also includes procedures to designate and publicize the ports to which foreign fishing vessels may seek entry and procedures for conducting inspections of these foreign vessels accessing U.S. ports. Further, the rule establishes procedures for notification of: the denial of port entry or port services for a foreign vessel, the withdrawal of the denial of port services if applicable, the taking of enforcement action with respect to a foreign vessel, or the results of any inspection of a foreign vessel to the flag nation of the vessel and other competent authorities as appropriate.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"NMFS listed 5 Caribbean corals as threatened under the Endangered Species Act on October 10, 2014.  Critical habitat shall be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable at the time a species is proposed for listing (50 CFR 424.12). We concluded that critical habitat was not determinable for the 5 corals at the time of listing. However, we anticipated that critical habitat would be determinable in the future given on-going research. We, therefore, announced in the final listing rules that we would propose critical habitat in separate rulemakings. This rule proposes to designate critical habitat for the 5 Caribbean coral species listed in 2014.  A separate proposed critical habitat rule is being prepared for the 15 Indo-Pacific corals listed as threatened in 2014. The proposed designation for the Caribbean corals may include marine waters in Florida, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Navassa Island, and Flower Garden Banks containing essential features that support all stages of life history of the corals.  The proposed rule is not likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect the economy. NMFS has contacted the Departments of the Navy, Air Force, and Army as well as the U.S. Coast Guard requesting information related to potential national security impacts that may result from the critical habitat designation.  Based on information provided, we concluded that there will be an impact on national security in only 1 area offshore Dania Beach, FL, and will propose to exclude it from the designations.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"The current regulations for Inspection and Certification by the NMFS Seafood Inspection Program have not been significantly updated since the 1970s. They contain outdated language, procedures, and definitions, and have many inconsistencies with current practices of the Seafood Inspection Program. This rule would update and revise the Seafood Inspection Program's implementing regulations by updating and adding definitions, eliminating and updating certain procedures, and clarifying current language and titles (e.g., sampler vs. inspector). The updates and changes are necessary to reflect current operating procedures of the Seafood Inspection Program, and modern business practices (e.g., use of credit cards and the Internet). In addition, the regulations for the U.S. Standards for Grades of Fish and Fishery Products would be revised to increase uniformity in inspection results, decrease inspection time, and maintain fairness, reliability and validity of inspection results. Sample size, sample unit, grading procedures, and grade determinations will all be updated and codified in the regulations.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"Current Federal regulations prohibit vessels, defined as vessels equal to or greater than 50 ft in length, from fishing for pelagic management unit species within the large vessel prohibited area 12 nautical miles from American Samoa (the ""large vessel prohibited area""). This action would implement a decision by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council on an exemption for longline vessels 50 ft and longer holding an American Samoa longline limited entry permit to fish within certain portions of the area.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,This action would implement the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council's Amendment 9 to the Fishery Ecosystem Plan for Pacific Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (Pelagics Fishery Ecosystem Plan). Amendment 9 would modify the longline limited entry program. The management objectives of the limited entry program are to: 1) prevent local depletion; 2) maintain sustained community participation in the fishery; 3) ensure opportunities for participation by indigenous American Samoans; 4) reduce gear conflicts; and 5) minimize fish bycatch. Amendment 9's modifications are intended to reduce programmatic barriers that may be limiting small vessel participation in the fishery.,Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"The proposed action would implement a regulatory amendment to the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan to allow bottom trawl and midwater trawl vessels targeting non-whiting species the option to use electronic monitoring (video cameras and associated sensors) in place of observers to meet requirements for 100-percent observer coverage. By allowing vessels the option to use electronic monitoring to meet monitoring requirements, this action is intended to increase operational flexibility and reduce monitoring costs for the fleet.",Fall_2020

Deregulatory,"The Bureau of Reclamation plans to release Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the upper Sacramento and McCloud Rivers above Shasta Dam for species recovery purposes. This action proposes to designate the fish released as nonessential experimental populations under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. The proposed nonessential experimental populations are not expected to have a significant impact because the section 7(a)(2) consultation requirement would not apply to Federal agency actions affecting the experimental populations. Additionally, take that is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and is not willful, knowing, or due to negligence would not be prohibited. Otherwise lawful activities include, but are not limited to, agricultural, water management, power generation, construction, recreation, fishing, or forestry practices, when such activities are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Similarly, take caused by any activity taken pursuant to a permit issued by NMFS under section 10 of the Endangered Species Act would not be prohibited. Aid, disposal, and salvage of fish by authorized personnel acting in compliance with threatened marine and anadromous species regulations would also not be prohibited.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"NMFS may modify the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plans Massachusetts Trap/Pot Restricted Area and the Great South Channel Trap/Pot Restricted Area. Large whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries and mortalities still occur at levels that, for North Atlantic right whales, exceed the levels established by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In accordance to recommendations from the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, NMFS believes modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) are needed to meet the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Currently the plan has seasonal trap/pot closures in two areas: Massachusetts Restricted Area and the Great South Channel. This rulemaking would allow trap/pot fishing that does not use vertical buoy lines (referred to as buoy-lineless or ropeless gear) prior to gear retrieval in these areas. By opening these areas to allow this type of gear, it is expected that a portion of previously excluded fishermen will regain access to fishing grounds--potentially leading to revenue increase as well as additional to develop practical and economically feasible buoy lineless gear technologies and techniques. These technologies and techniques will provide long-term options for helping reduce large whale entanglements in the future.",Fall_2020

Potential management measures could include modifications to pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries as well as other bluefin tuna fisheries, which would increase flexibility for fishery participants.",Fall_2020
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would address conducting research in areas currently closed to fishing for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS)--during various times or by certain gear-- to collect fishery-dependent data. A number of time/area closures or gear-restricted areas have been implemented over the years through various rulemakings, limiting fishing for Atlantic highly migratory species in those areas for a variety of reasons including reducing bycatch. These time/area closures have been implemented in consultation with the HMS Advisory Panel to protect species consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (e.g., to reduce bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off the east coast of Florida), the Endangered Species Act (e.g., to protect sea turtles in the North Atlantic), and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (e.g., to protect spawning bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico). Fishery-dependent data supports effective fisheries management, and areas that restrict fishing effort often have a commensurate decrease in fishery-dependent data collection. Programs to facilitate research and data collection, such as those that would be covered by this rulemaking, could assess the efficacy of closed areas, improve sustainable management of highly migratory species, and may provide benefits to commercial and recreational fishermen.",Fall_2020

Of the 15 Indo-Pacific species, seven occur in U.S. waters of the Pacific Islands Region, including in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, and the Pacific Remote Island Areas. This proposed rule would designate critical habitat for the seven species in U.S. waters (Acropora globiceps, Acropora jacquelineae, Acropora retusa, Acropora speciosa, Euphyllia paradivisa, Isopora crateriformis, and Seriatopora aculeata). A separate proposed rule will designate critical habitat for the listed Caribbean coral species. The proposed designation may cover coral reef habitat around 13 island or atoll units in the Pacific Islands Region, including three in American Samoa, one in Guam, seven in the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, and two in Pacific Remote Island Areas, containing essential features that support reproduction, growth, and survival of the listed coral species. NMFS has contacted the Departments of the Navy, Air Force, and Army as well as the U.S. Coast Guard requesting information related to potential national security impacts that may result from the critical habitat designation. Based on information provided, we will determine whether to propose to exclude any areas based on national security impacts.",Fall_2020
Regulatory,"NMFS published a final rule to list the Beringia Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of bearded seals as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in December 2012, thereby triggering the requirement under section 4 of the ESA to designate critical habitat for the Beringia DPS to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. NMFS has already initiated rulemaking to establish critical habitat for Arctic ringed seals, which were also listed as threatened under the ESA in December 2012, and that action is proceeding separately. This rulemaking action proposes to designate critical habitat in areas occupied by bearded seals in U.S. waters over the continental shelf in the northern Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. Impacts from the designation of critical habitat for Beringia DPS bearded seals would stem from the statutory requirement that Federal agencies consult with NMFS under section 7 of the ESA to ensure that any action they carry out, authorize, or fund is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of bearded seal critical habitat.

The regulation also includes time frames for certain steps in the mitigation bank and in-lieu fee program review and approval process. The review and approval process for mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs includes an opportunity for public and agency review and comment, as well as a second review by an interagency review team. The interagency review team consists of Federal, Tribal, State, and local agencies that review documentation and provide the Corps advice on the establishment and management of mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs. The Corps is reviewing the review and approval process and the interagency review team process to determine whether there may be ways to enhance the efficiency of the mitigation bank and in-lieu fee program approval time frames by generating savings to the public through shorter review times for proposed mitigation banks, in-lieu fee programs, instrument modifications, and credit release requests while also promoting conservation and wetland mitigation projects. The Corps will also consider whether there are opportunities for efficiency and clarity improvement from relying on other types of credit metrics for stream compensatory mitigation projects rather than linear metrics.

FMCSA proposes to eliminate the requirement that drivers operating commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce prepare and submit a list of their convictions for traffic violations to their employers annually. This requirement is largely duplicative of a separate provision that requires each motor carrier to make an annual inquiry to obtain the motor vehicle record (MVR) for each driver it employs from every State in which the driver holds or has held a CMV operator's license or permit in the past year. To ensure motor carriers are aware of traffic violations for a driver who is licensed by a foreign authority rather than by a State, that provision would be amended to provide that motor carriers must make an annual inquiry to each driver's licensing authority where a driver holds or has held a CMV operator's license or permit. This change would require motor carriers to request the MVR equivalent from Canadian and Mexican driver's licensing authorities.

Since then, strides have been made to identify and control railroad grade crossings with sophisticated arm and light systems. FMCSA would also amend the related requirement found at 49 CFR section 392.11. This provision, also from 1937, requires commercial motor vehicles other than buses and HMVs to slow down when approaching railroad-highway grade crossings.

NHTSA has not updated the code appendix since 2005, while AAMVA has recently completed an update to its code dictionary. So that State motor vehicle administrators have a consistent set of codes as between NDR and AAMVA, this action seeks to update the appendix so that the appendix codes match AAMVA's revised code dictionary. This is a non-substantive rulemaking and NHTSA does not anticipate adding any costs to State compliance under the program. The codes are already used at a State level for a variety of licensing purposes and have been used as part of identifying problem drivers to the NDR for over 20 years.",Fall_2020

Regulatory,"On April 17, 2015, the EPA promulgated national minimum criteria for existing and new coal combustion residuals (CCR) landfills and surface impoundments (2015 CCR rule). On August 14, 2019, the EPA proposed to revise two provisions of the 2015 CCR rule that were remanded back to the EPA in 2018 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. First, the EPA proposed to revise the CCR beneficial use definition by replacing the mass-based numerical threshold with specific location-based criteria as the trigger for conducting an environmental demonstration. Second, the EPA proposed to introduce a single approach to consistently address the potential environmental and human health issues associated with piles of CCR, regardless of the location of the pile and whether the CCR is destined for disposal or beneficial use. Based on the public comments received on the August 2019 proposal, the Agency does not intend to take final action at this time on the proposed revisions for the beneficial use definition and requirements for managing piles of CCR. The Agency continues to reconsider these issues and plans to seek additional information. Pending the review and analysis of any additional information found, the Agency will determine the appropriate next steps. While these two issues are under the Agency's reconsideration, the provisions promulgated in the 2015 CCR rule remain in place for the beneficial use definition and piles of CCR. Finally, the EPA also proposed several additional targeted changes to the existing CCR regulations, including revisions to the annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report requirements, establishing an alternative risk-based groundwater protection standard for boron, and revisions to the publicly accessible CCR website requirements.

Deregulatory,"In the final e-Manifest User Fee Rule issued in January, 2018, EPA explained that the scope of the e-Manifest requirements and system did not extend to export shipments of hazardous wastes from the U.S. Export shipments were excluded from e-Manifest in that final rule because EPA had not determined which entity in the export process would be responsible for submitting export manifests to the e-Manifest system and paying the associated user fees. Also, the ""receiver pays"" approach that was generally applicable to domestic shipments in that final rule was not suitable in the export context, as the receiver of exported wastes is a foreign entity. Thus, in this action we are considering a regulatory change to address which entity involved in the export supply chain is best suited to (1) submit export manifests to EPA and (2) pay the requisite user fee for the processing of export manifests so that exported wastes may be included in the scope of the e-Manifest system. Additionally, we are considering revisions to the manifest forms so that manifest data for import and export shipments can be recorded more clearly on them. This rule also considers revisions to the export and import shipment movement document related requirements to more closely link the manifest data with the movement document data, and various technical corrections and conforming amendments to import and export requirements. This action addresses several manifest-related reports that are required when there are specific manifested waste shipment problems. The current regulations require the following reports to be submitted in writing: (1) an Exception Report from generators when a signed manifest confirming the receipt of wastes by the designated facility is overdue; (2) a Discrepancy Report from the designated receiving facility when the waste received differs significantly in quantity or type from the waste that the generator indicated was shipped, and (3) an Unmanifested Waste Report from a receiving facility when a shipment arrives at the receiving facility that was not accompanied by a manifest, but should have been tracked with a manifest required under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Since much of the manifest information that is the basis for these separate reports will be available and trackable in e-Manifest, this action considers regulatory changes to the regulations for the manifested related reports so that they can be transmitted electronically and more efficiently in e-Manifest rather than as separate, written reports. This action also considers applicable revisions to the federal manifest regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) so that they align with the RCRA manifest regulations and the e-Manifest Program. Finally, this action may also provide an opportunity to address other technical regulatory changes that may be suggested by stakeholders.",Fall_2020

In particular, in-use engine NOx emission levels from heavy-duty vehicles can be significantly higher than their certified values under certain conditions. NOx emissions are major precursors of ozone and significant contributors to secondary PM2.5 formation. Ozone and ambient PM2.5 concentrations continue to be a nationwide health and air quality issue. Reducing NOx emissions from on-highway, heavy-duty trucks and buses is an important component of improving air quality nationwide and reducing public health and welfare effects associated with these pollutants, especially for vulnerable populations and in highly impacted regions.

Portions of these regulations are more appropriately communicated to potential applicants through an EDA Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which specifically addresses the program requirements for applying for grants in a particular fiscal year that may change from year to year to reflect Administration priorities or changing economic circumstances. Moreover, those interested in the specific requirements of such grants generally know to review grants.gov for those requirements rather than the regulations. EDA proposes to retain those portions of these regulations that direct applicants to look to the NOFO for specific requirements and that establish certain procedural steps that require regulations (e.g., EDA does not accept appeals of denied applications and limits on indirect costs).

This will allow CR Program fishery participants operational flexibility to conduct their business in an efficient manner, in particular when emergencies or special circumstances arise, while also ensuring proper catch accounting. The prohibition against continuing to fish for CR crab after an offload has begun and until the offload is complete simplified port sampling and catch accounting. While fishing after a partial delivery was fairly common practice pre-CR Program when vessels were racing to catch and deliver crab, the program intended to, and has, increased coordination between harvesters and processors, which has allowed for an increase in the efficiency of offloads. Thus, NMFS and the North Pacific Council expect this proposed flexibility would only be used in emergency situations or special circumstances related to the safety or economics of the operations. It is not anticipated that partial deliveries followed by additional fishing would become a routine operating procedure, and therefore concerns about complicating catch accounting are minimal.",Spring_2020

This proposed rule will also implement the Port State Measures Agreement. To that end, this proposed rule will require the collection of certain information from foreign fishing vessels requesting permission to use U.S. ports. It also includes procedures to designate and publicize the ports to which foreign fishing vessels may seek entry and procedures for conducting inspections of these foreign vessels accessing U.S. ports. Further, the rule establishes procedures for notification of: the denial of port entry or port services for a foreign vessel, the withdrawal of the denial of port services if applicable, the taking of enforcement action with respect to a foreign vessel, or the results of any inspection of a foreign vessel to the flag nation of the vessel and other competent authorities as appropriate.",Spring_2020

We concluded that critical habitat was not determinable for the 5 corals at the time of listing. However, we anticipated that critical habitat would be determinable in the future given on-going research. We, therefore, announced in the final listing rules that we would propose critical habitat in separate rulemakings. This rule proposes to designate critical habitat for the 5 Caribbean coral species listed in 2014.Â  A separate proposed critical habitat rule is being prepared for the 15 Indo-Pacific corals listed as threatened in 2014. The proposed designation for the Caribbean corals may include marine waters in Florida, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Navassa Island, and Flower Garden Banks containing essential features that support all stages of life history of the corals.

In accordance to recommendations from the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, NMFS believes modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) are needed to meet the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Currently the plan has seasonal trap/pot closures in two areas: Massachusetts Restricted Area and the Great South Channel. This rulemaking would allow trap/pot fishing that does not use vertical buoy lines (referred to as buoy-lineless or ropeless gear) prior to gear retrieval in these areas. By opening these areas to allow this type of gear, it is expected that a portion of previously excluded fishermen will regain access to fishing grounds--potentially leading to revenue increase as well as additional to develop practical and economically feasible buoy lineless gear technologies and techniques.

A number of time/area closures or gear-restricted areas have been implemented over the years through various rulemakings, limiting fishing for Atlantic highly migratory species in those areas for a variety of reasons including reducing bycatch. These time/area closures have been implemented in consultation with the HMS Advisory Panel to protect species consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (e.g., to reduce bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off the east coast of Florida), the Endangered Species Act (e.g., to protect sea turtles in the North Atlantic), and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (e.g., to protect spawning bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico). Fishery-dependent data supports effective fisheries management, and areas that restrict fishing effort often have a commensurate decrease in fishery-dependent data collection.

CQEs are non-profit organizations that hold fishery privileges, including IFQ, for the benefit of eligible rural coastal communities. Currently, in area 3A the class of IFQ must be matched to the class of vessel used to harvest it. ""Dâ€ class IFQ must be harvested on vessels less than 35 feet Length over all (LOA) and ""Câ€ class IFQ must be harvested on vessels less than or equal to 60 feet LOA.

Affected stakeholders testified to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) that ""Dâ€ class vessels are not always available in rural communities to harvest IFQ, which can lead to the IFQ going unharvested. Use of this provision would be limited to after August 15 each year, which is near the end of the IFQ season. Implementing this harvest flexibility late in the IFQ season as a contingency measure strikes a reasonable balance with the Councilâ€™s intent for the vessel/quota class system to maintain historical harvest patterns by vessel size, and the intent of the CQE Program to facilitate and maintain access to fishery resources for rural coastal communities. This action would apply to a relatively small amount of IFQ held by CQEs in area 3A, up to a maximum of approximately 10 percent of all area 3A ""Dâ€ class IFQ. Use of this provision would be voluntary, with the additional end-of-season harvest flexibility potentially providing marginal benefits to CQEs.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This action proposes to implement the North Pacific Fishery Management Councilâ€™s Amendments to the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (Amendment 121) and Gulf of Alaska (Amendment 110) Groundfish Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). These Amendments would move sculpins into the Ecosystem Component of the FMPs, which is a category of non-target species that are not in need of conservation and management. Magnuson-Stevens Act National Standard guidelines include options to identify non-target species in FMPs (species caught incidentally during the pursuit of target stocks in a fishery) that do not require conservation and management as ecosystem component species. As an Ecosystem Component, this action proposes that catch specifications for sculpins (Overfishing Level, Acceptable Biological Catch, Total Allowable Catch) would no longer be required, but instead, regulations would prohibit directed fishing forsculpins, require recordkeeping and reporting to monitor and report catch of sculpins annually, and establish a sculpins maximum retainable amount when directed fishing for groundfish species at 20 percent to discourage retention while allowing flexibility to prosecute groundfish fisheries. This proposed action would free up approximately 5,000 metric tons (mt) of total allowable catch (TAC) under the 2 million mt optimum yield limit for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands management area.

Critical habitat for this population is currently designated within inland waters of Washington. In response to a 2014 petition, NMFS is proposing to expand the designation to include areas occupied by Southern Resident killer whales in waters along the U.S. West Coast. Impacts from the designation would stem mainly from Federal agencies' requirement to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, permit (authorize), or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of a listed species. Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to the currently designated critical habitat in inland waters of Washington, but consultation would be newly required for actions affecting the expanded critical habitat areas. Federal agencies are also already required to consult within the Southern Resident killer whales' range (including along the U.S. West Coast) to ensure that any action they carry out, permit, or fund will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species; this requirement would not change with a revision to the critical habitat designation.",Spring_2020

The three distinct population segments of humpback whales concerned--the Mexico, Central American, and Western Pacific distinct population segments--were listed under the Endangered Species Act on September 8, 2016, thereby triggering the requirement under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. Proposed critical habitat for these three distinct population segments of humpback whales will include marine habitats within the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea and will likely overlap with several existing designations, including critical habitat for leatherback sea turtles, North Pacific right whales, Steller sea lions, southern resident killer whales, and the southern distinct population segment of green sturgeon. Impacts from the designations for humpback whales would stem from the statutory requirement for Federal agencies to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, authorize, or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of humpback whale critical habitat. Within many of the areas we are evaluating for potential proposal as critical habitat for the humpback whales distinct population segments, Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to currently designated critical habitat for other listed species.

During public comment at Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) meetings, commercial fishers have indicated a preference for as long of a fishing season as possible since these incidentally caught fish must be discarded if the season is closed. The Council developed a framework amendment to the Reef Fish FMP to address public concerns regarding greater amberjack. In response to the Council's recommendation, this rulemaking proposes to modify the Reef Fish FMP to reduce the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) greater amberjack commercial trip limit from 1,500 pounds gutted weight to 1,000 pounds gutted weight with a step-down to 250 pounds when 75 percent of the quota has been landed.Â The need for the rule is to extend the Gulf greater amberjack commercial fishing season by constraining the harvest rate while continuing to prevent overfishing and rebuild the stock.",Spring_2020

The proposed rule would modify the type-approval requirements to allow for communication service by cellular EMTUs (EMTU-Cs), in addition to satellite-only models. The need for the rule is to set out procedures and requirements for initial type-approvals; compliance with, and revocations and appeals of type-approvals; and technical, service, and performance specifications. This would allow EMTU-Cs to be type-approved and used in certain federally managed fisheries with a VMS requirement.

Fishery specific total allowable landings (TALs) and possession limits are set as part of an annual review and specifications process. Framework 8 contains skate fishery specifications for the 2020-2021 fishing years. According to the best scientific information available to allow the fishery to achieve optimum yield, this action proposes an increase in the annual catch limit and overall total allowable landings that would result in about a 13-percent increase each in both the bait and wing fisheriesâ€™ total allowable landings.

Currently, DFARS clause 252.204-7012, Network Penetration and Safeguarding of Covered Defense Information, requires contractors to provide adequate security for controlled unclassified information for which the minimum requirement is to implement the security requirements in NIST SP 800-171. The DoD standard methodology validates contractor implementation of the security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 in a consistent and objective manner. As a result of this rule, contractors will be required to review their system security plans and provide an implementation self-assessment to DoD in accordance with the scoring methodology. The score reflects the net effect of security requirements not yet implemented. Depending on the criticality of the data, DoD may also choose to review the system security plans, get additional information from the contractor through interviews, and ask for clarification in the plan by the contractor. For very critical systems, DoD may request an on-site validation/demonstration to ensure a high level of confidence with the implementation of NIST SP 800-171 requirements.

These requirements will implement the training and manning provisions of the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low Flashpoint Fuels, commonly known as the IGF Code; create national endorsements for vessels utilizing gases or low flashpoint fuels; and implement the training and manning provisions of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, commonly known as the Polar Code.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"The Coast Guard proposes to removeÂ four Coast Guard merchant mariner training requirements related to STCW officer and rating endorsements from its regulations in 46 CFR parts 11 and 12. The Coast Guard has determined these training requirements exceed current international certification and training standards of the STCW and cause a misalignment between the training of U.S. mariners and the mariners of other countries. These training requirements are not necessary for the safety of life and property at sea. The rule would remove: leadership and managerial skills training to qualify as master of vessels of less than 500 gross tons limited to near-coastal waters; demonstration of meeting the standard of competence in leadership and teamworking (LTW) skills to renew an endorsement as officer in charge of a navigational watch (OICNW) on vessels of less than 500 GT limited to near-coastal waters after January 1, 2017;Â bridge resource management training to qualify as officer in charge of a navigational watch on vessels of lessÂ than 500 gross tons limited to near-coastal waters; and computer systems and maintenance training to qualify as electro- technical rating on vessels powered by main propulsion machinery of 750 kW/1,000 HP or more.",Spring_2020

Deregulatory,"This rule amends the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s regulations regarding the submission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form I-418, Passenger List - Crew List (Form I-418). Currently, the master or agent of every commercial vessel arriving in the United States, with limited exceptions, must submit a paper Form I-418, along with certain information regarding longshore work, to CBP at the port where immigration inspection is performed. Most commercial vessel operators are also required to submit a paper Form I-418 to CBP at the final U.S. port prior to departing for a foreign port. Under this rule, most vessel operators would beÂ required to electronically submit the data elements on Form I-418 to CBP through the National Vessel Movement Center in lieu of submitting a paper form. This rule would eliminate the need to file the paper Form I-418 in most cases. This will result in an opportunity cost savings for vessel operators as well as a reduction in their printing and storage costs. CBP no longer needs this information as it is receiving it from the Coast Guard.",Spring_2020

Since that time, requirements for the protection of SSI have been modified by a subsequent IFR (2005) and regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), TSA, and Department of Homeland Security. These modifications have resulted in inconsistencies between TSA and OST regulations. TSA is issuing a final rule that will harmonizeÂ TSA's regulations with DOT's requirements, and reduce regulatory burden through streamlining certain requirements and eliminating others.

HUDâ€™s regulations implementing the requirements of Section 3 have not been updated since 1994 and are not as effective at promoting economic opportunity for low-income persons as HUD believes they could be. This rule updates HUDâ€™s Section 3 regulations to streamline reporting requirements by aligning the reporting with standard business practice; amending the applicability section; updating reporting and adding new outcome benchmarks; and integrating Section 3 into program enforcement.

The rule would require the verification of the eligible immigration status of all recipients of assistance under a covered program who are under the age of 62. The rule would also specify that individuals who are not in eligible immigration status may not serve as the leaseholder, even as part of a mixed family whose assistance is prorated based on the percentage of members with eligible status.

OSHA concluded that employees exposed to beryllium and beryllium compounds at the preceding permissible exposure limits (PELs) were at significant risk of material impairment of health, specifically chronic beryllium disease and lung cancer.Â  OSHA also concluded that the new 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) PEL of Âµg/m3 reduced this significant risk to the maximum extent feasible.Â  OSHA has evidence that beryllium exposure in construction and shipyards occurs almost exclusively during abrasive blasting and welding operations. OSHA is proposing to revise its standards for occupational exposure to beryllium and beryllium compounds in the construction and shipyards industries. These proposed changes are designed to accomplish three goals: (1) to more appropriately tailor the requirements of the construction and shipyards standards to the particular exposures in these industries in light of partial overlap between the beryllium standardsâ€™ requirements and other OSHA standards; (2) to more closely align the shipyards and construction standards to the general industry standard, where appropriate; and (3) to clarify certain requirements with respect to materials containing only trace amounts of beryllium.",Spring_2020

These lung diseases are irreversible and may ultimately be fatal. MSHAâ€™s existing standards limit minersâ€™ exposures to quartz in respirable dust. MSHAâ€™s metal and nonmetal mine standards are based on the 1973 American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values formula: 10 mg/m3 divided by the percentage of silica plus 2. MSHAâ€™s existing coal mine standards evaluate minersâ€™ exposure to quartz in relation to the respirable dust standard. When respirable coal mine dust samples are analyzed for quartz and exceed 0.1 mg/m3 (100 micrograms per cubic meter of air or Âµg/m3), the Agency reduces the applicable respirable dust standard for sections of the mine represented by the sample data.

Existing airworthiness standards are inadequate because they do not address increasing design complexity. To address these advances, the FAA currently issues reoccurring special conditions, equivalent level of safety findings (ELOS), and means of compliance (MOC) issue papers. This rulemaking would address these problem areas by updating those standards that cause unnecessary burdens in cost and time to both the FAA and the rotorcraft industry. By updating the affected standards, many special conditions, ELOS findings, and MOC issue papers would be unnecessary, thus reducing the burden and cost on both the FAA and industry",Spring_2020
Regulatory,"This rulemaking would provide an alternative, streamlined and simple, web-based aircraft registration process for the registration of small unmanned aircraft, including small unmanned aircraft operated as model aircraft, to facilitate compliance with the statutory requirement that all aircraft register prior to operation. It would also provide a simpler method for marking small unmanned aircraft that is more appropriate for these aircraft. This action responds to public comments received regarding the proposed registration process in the Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft notice of proposed rulemaking, the request for information regarding unmanned aircraft system registration, and the recommendations from the Unmanned Aircraft System Registration Task Force.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would address the performance-based standards and means-of-compliance for operation of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) over people not directly participating in the operation or not under a covered structure or inside a stationary vehicle that can provide reasonable protection from a falling small unmanned aircraft. This rule would provide relief from certain operational restrictions implemented in the Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems final rule (RIN 2120-AJ60).,Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would update title references, update outdated statutory and regulatory references, update outdated addresses, and provide uniformity with other subparts.  The intended effect of this action would eliminate inconsistencies and clarify ambiguity.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would allow pilots with 121 pilot in command (PIC) experience prior to July 31, 2013, but who were not serving as a PIC on the date, to count that time towards the 1,000 hours of air carrier experience required to serve as a PIC in part 121 today.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would revise the operation of experimental light sport aircraft. The current regulations prohibit the use of these aircraft for flight training for compensation or hire, which, if allowed, would increase safety. This action would remove the restriction that currently prevents flight training and allow for it under the existing FAA letter of deviation authority authorization process.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would revise regulations that impose a duplicative requirement on foreign applicants for type certificates of import products. Existing FAA regulations require all applicants to submit two documents: a compliance listing to document the means of compliance with applicable standards; and a corresponding compliance certification from the applicant certifying that all the requirements in the certification basis have been complied with. These compliance statements are duplicative and redundant to the certifying statement that the FAA already requires from the foreign civil aviation authority of the country or jurisdiction having State of Design responsibility for the design approval holder of the product. This rulemaking would no longer require either the compliance listing or the accompanying compliance certification from the foreign applicant.,Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This action would allow non-structural walls (partitions) to collapse if they are immediately adjacent to a sudden hole in the fuselage skin of a size that would cause a rapid decompression. Compliance to the rule as written would require substantial structural strength for these small compartments, and could create unintended, unsafe consequences for the airframe structure, such as the floor beams, if these partitions were strengthened. Certification to the revised standard would allow partitions to collapse in a controlled manner and in a way that continues to protect the occupants from contact and injury to the extent practical.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This action would remove the requirement for a Class III medical certificate for a check airman who is not serving as a flightcrew member in part 135 operations.,Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This action would revise regulations so that airplane type designs can include cabin pressurization and oxygen systems suitable for operations into and out of airports with elevations that exceed 8,000 feet. In addition, this action would eliminate the need for industry to submit a request for exemption to oxygen regulations (for airplanes used for operations into and out of airports with an elevation above 14,000 feet). This action would also harmonize Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) practices with those of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would remove the requirement that all aircraft equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) must transmit at all times. This rule provides an exception to ADS-B requirements, removing the transmission requirement for certain operations carried out in the interest of national security. The changes would provide relief to those government agencies that operate aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out but require the ability to terminate the transmission signal when conducting national security, sensitive, intelligence and law enforcement missions that could be compromised by the requirement to transmit flight information over non-encrypted signals. This rulemaking would also allow air traffic control to direct an operator to terminate transmission when it would jeopardize the safe functioning of ATC.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"This action would fundamentally change how the FAA licenses launches and reentries in 14 CFR chapter III by proposing a regulatory approach that relies on performance-based regulations rather than prescriptive regulations. This action would primarily consolidate and revise parts 415, 417, 431, and 435 into a single regulatory part that states safety objectives to be achieved for the launch of suborbital and orbital expendable and reusable launch vehicles, and the reentry of reentry vehicles, and will leave design or operational solutions up to the applicant. This action will be accompanied by a body of Advisory Circulars or standards that collectively provide at least one acceptable means of compliance for all performance-based regulations in the new part. This action would also enable flexible timeframes, remove unnecessary ground safety regulations, redefine when launch begins to allow specified pre-flight operations prior to license approval, and allow applicants to seek a license to launch from multiple sites. This proposal would significantly streamline and simplify licensing of launch and reentry operations, would enable novel operations, and would result in net cost savings.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This action would remove an unnecessary training requirement for pilots seeking to obtain an initial airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate in the airplane category with a single-engine class rating concurrently with a type rating for a single engine airplane.,Spring_2020

Deregulatory,"The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, section 349, Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft repealed section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and established specific self-enacting requirements for those former section 336 unmanned aircraft systems operators who are regulated under 14 CFR part 101, subpart E (14 CFR 101E). Therefore, the provisions in the 2018 Act supersede the provisions in 14 CFR 101E. FAA seeks to repeal 14 CFR 101E because the existence of both requirements is conflicting and misleading to UAS operators.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"As part of our retrospective regulatory review, the FHWA intends to update 23 CFR part 772. This part was substantially updated in 2010; however, substantial comments from stakeholders and the public have suggested that the part could be rewritten for clarity and ease of use. The FHWA will assess ways to streamline its regulation, increase clarity, and improve the Noise Abatement process.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would propose changes to 23 CFR part 771.  Potential changes include: reorganization of FHWA's categorical exclusions (CEs) section; moving additional CEs from the d-list to the c-list; revising the timeframe for when an applicant is required to prepare a written re-evaluation from 3 years to 5 years; and revisiting language in 771.117(e) to potentially remove the constraints in paragraph (e) or exclude 4R projects and those adding or widening shoulders or adding guard rail improvements that cause shoulder widening from application of the subsection (e) constraints.,Spring_2020

Regulatory,"This rulemaking would update the Indian Reservation Roads Bridge Program (IRRBP) regulations at 23 CFR 661.  These updates will align the regulatory language with the statutory language changes made by section 1119 of MAP-21 and section 1118 of the FAST Act, including changing the name of the program to the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP).  This update will also delete the structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, and sufficiency rating language to align the Tribal Transportation Bridge Program terminology for bridge conditions with the terminology used for State DOTs in the Federal-aid Highway Program to provide a consistent means of classifying and referring to bridge condition.  Finally, this rulemaking would update the eligibility requirements for bridge rehabilitation or replacement and would provide clarifications to the Tribal Governments when submitting a bridge application.",Spring_2020
Regulatory,"This rulemaking would implement section 607 of the Mobile Now Act, as included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-141). Section 607 directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations to ensure that each State that receives funds under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code (U.S.C.), meets certain requirements to facilitate the installation of broadband infrastructure. The requirements include broadband consultation among the State department of transportation and appropriate State agencies and a requirement that a State that chooses to provide for the installation of broadband infrastructure in the right-of-way of a Federal-aid highway project under this regulation carry out any appropriate measures to ensure that any existing broadband infrastructure entities are not disadvantaged, as compared to other broadband infrastructure entities, with respect to the program under this regulation.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would update the regulation pertaining to driver-related penalties at 23 CFR part 192 to reduce the administrative burdens placed on States by the certification requirement in the current regulation and to make changes to conform to the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).,Spring_2020

The CMV driving ban is intended to keep these drivers off the road until they comply with return-to-duty (RTD) requirements. FMCSA also seeks comment on alternate proposals establishing additional ways that SDLAs would use information, obtained through the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse), to increase compliance with the CMV driving prohibition. Further, the Agency proposes to revise how reports of actual knowledge violations, based on a citation for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in a CMV, would be maintained in the Clearinghouse. These proposed changes would improve highway safety by increasing compliance with existing drug and alcohol program requirements.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would propose changes to eliminate a requirement that drivers operating commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce prepare and submit a list of their convictions for traffic violations to their employers annually. This requirement is largely duplicative of a separate provision that requires each motor carrier to make an annual inquiry to obtain the motor vehicle record (MVR) for each driver it employs from every State in which the driver holds or has held a CMV operator's license or permit in the past year. FMCSA expects that removing the requirement would reduce the paperwork burden on drivers and motor carriers without adversely affecting CMV safety.,Spring_2020

Regulatory,The EPA proposed the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) to include a suite of actions to reduce lead exposure in drinking water where it is needed the most. The proposed rule identifies the most at-risk communities to ensure systems have plans in place to rapidly respond by taking actions to reduce elevated levels of lead in drinking water. The proposed LCR maintains the current Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) of zero and the Action Level of 15 ppb. The proposed rule would require a more comprehensive response at the action level and introduces a trigger level of 10 ppb that requires more proactive planning in communities with lead service lines. The proposed revisions also include requirements for water systems to prepare an inventory of known lead service lines and to make the inventory publicly available. The proposal takes a proactive and holistic approach to improving the current rule -- from testing to treatment to telling the public about the levels and risks of lead in drinking water. This approach focuses on the following six key areas: 1) identifying areas most impacted; 2) strengthening treatment requirements; 3) replacing lead service lines; 4) increasing sampling; 5) improving risk communication; and 6) protecting children in schools.,Spring_2020

Deregulatory,"In the final e-Manifest User Fee Rule issued in January, 2018, EPA explained that the scope of the e-Manifest requirements and system did not extend to export shipments of hazardous wastes from the U.S. Export shipments were excluded from e-Manifest in that final rule, because EPA had not determined which entity in the export process would be responsible for submitting export manifests to the e-Manifest system and paying the associated user fees. Also, the ""receiver pays"" approach that was generally applicable to domestic shipments in that final rule was not suitable in the export context, as the receiver of exported wastes is a foreign entity. Thus, in this action we are proposing a new regulatory change to address which entity involved in the export supply chain is best suited to (1) submit export manifests to EPA and (2) pay the requisite user fee for the processing of export manifests so that exported wastes may be included in the scope of the e-Manifest system. This action will also address the several manifest-related reports that are required when there are specific manifested waste shipment problems. The current regulations require the following reports to be submitted in writing: (1) an Exception Report from generators when a signed manifest confirming the receipt of wastes by the designated facility is overdue; (2) a Discrepancy Report from the designated receiving facility when the waste received differs significantly in quantity or type from the waste that the generator indicated was shipped, and (3) an Unmanifested Waste Report from a receiving facility when a shipment arrives at the receiving facility that was not accompanied by a manifest, but should have been tracked with a manifest required under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Since much of the manifest information that is the basis for these separate reports will be available and trackable in e-Manifest, this action will pursue certain regulatory changes so that these reports can be transmitted electronically and more efficiently in e-Manifest rather than as separate, written reports.

On October 15, 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 rule to address issues for which EPA has granted administrative reconsideration, streamline implementation of the 2016 rule and clarify certain requirements in the rule. The proposed amendments include changes to the frequency for monitoring fugitive emissions at well sites and compressor stations; requirements for pneumatic pumps at well sites; and requirements that a professional engineer certify when meeting those requirements is technically infeasible. Additional proposed amendments related to the professional engineer certification of the design of closed vent systems and requirements for requesting alternative means of emissions limitations were also included. This action will finalize amendments, as appropriate.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"On December 20, 2018, the EPA proposed revised Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units, found at 40 CFR Part 60, subpart TTTT. The EPA proposed to amend the previous determination that the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for newly constructed coal-fired steam generating units (i.e., EGUs) is partial carbon capture and storage. Instead, the proposed revised BSER for this source category is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle (e.g., supercritical steam conditions for large units and subcritical steam conditions for small units) in combination with the best operating practices.",Spring_2020
Deregulatory,"In this action, EPA intends to update a regulation, appendix P to part 51, promulgated in 1975, specifying what State Implementation Plans (SIPs) must require of sources with continuous monitoring systems for four source categories under which EPA's earliest New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) required new or modified sources to have continuous monitoring systems. The four source categories are fossil fuel-fired steam generators, fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators, sulfuric acid plants, and nitric acid plants. What EPA specified for SIPs in appendix P to part 51 was, by design, similar to what EPA specified in part 60 NSPS regulations at that time, including the requirement to report excess emissions on a quarterly basis, at a minimum. In 1999, EPA relaxed the reporting frequency for most NSPS from quarterly to semiannual, but didn't change the appendix P to part 51 requirements. As a result, the still-quarterly requirement under appendix P to part 51 is no longer consistent with the NSPS requirements, as originally intended. In this action, EPA proposed to change the part 51 specified required minimum reporting frequency for sources with continuous monitoring systems from quarterly to semiannual. This would allow (but not require) states to reduce, through their SIPs, the required minimum frequency of excess emissions reporting for these four source categories from quarterly to semiannual. This would harmonize the minimum reporting frequency under SIPs with what EPA requires of the same source categories in numerous other, more recent, regulations, e.g., through NSPS (part 60), NESHAP (parts 61 and 63), and the title V operating permits program (parts 70 and 71).",Spring_2020
Regulatory,"This final rule addresses the agency's residual risk and technology review (RTR) of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing (MON). This NESHAP was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and established emission limitations and work practice requirements based on maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The MON, subpart FFFF, was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on November 10, 2003. The NESHAP controls emissions of HAP from continuous process vents, batch process vents, storage tanks, equipment leaks, wastewater streams, transfer racks and heat exchange systems. The HAP emitted from these sources include, but are not limited to, toluene, methanol, xylene, hydrogen chloride, methylene chloride and ethylene oxide. This action implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). CAA 112(f)(2) directs EPA to revise the NESHAP if such revisions are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect. CAA section 112(d)(6) requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes and control technologies, no less often than every 8 years. Pursuant to a court order (California Communities Against Toxics v. Pruitt, Case No: 1:15-cv-00512 (D.D.C.)), the EPA is obligated to complete the MON final action by May 29, 2020.

Deregulatory,"On June 3, 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule titled ""Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources; Final Rule."" Following promulgation of the final rule, the Administrator received petitions for reconsideration on several provisions in the rule. In a previous action, the EPA proposed those specific reconsideration issues on October 15, 2018. A number of states and industry associations sought judicial review of the 2016 rule, and the litigation is currently being held in abeyance. On March 28, 2017, newly elected President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13783 titled ""Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,"" which directs agencies to review existing regulations that potentially burden the development of domestic energy resources, and appropriately suspend, revise or rescind regulations that unduly burden the development of U.S. energy resources beyond what is necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. In 2017, the EPA provided notice to initiate the review of the 2016 rule and stated that, if appropriate, will initiate proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind the rule. Subsequently, in a notice dated June 5, 2017, the EPA further committed to look broadly at the entire 2016 rule.

Specifically, EPA proposed to amend the SNUR for LCPFAC chemical substances by designating as a significant new use manufacturing (including importing) or processing of an identified subset of LCPFAC chemical substances for any use that will not be ongoing after December 31, 2015, and all other LCPFAC chemicals substances for which there are currently no ongoing uses. EPA also proposed to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import LCPFAC chemical substances as part of articles. In addition, EPA proposed to amend a SNUR for perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS) chemical substances that would make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import PFAS chemical substances as part of carpets. Persons subject to these SNURs would be required to notify the EPA at least 90 days before commencing such manufacture or processing. The required notifications would initiate EPA's evaluation of the intended use within the applicable review period. Manufacture and processing for the significant new use would be unable to commence until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and taken such actions as are required in association with that determination. In a February 2020 supplemental proposal, EPA proposed to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import a subset of LCPFAC chemical substances as part of certain articles. The supplemental proposal is intended to be responsive to the article consideration provision in TSCA section 5(a)(5), that was added with the 2016 amendments to TSCA and which states that articles can be subject to notification requirements as a significant new use provided that EPA makes an affirmative finding in a rule that there is reasonable potential for exposure to a chemical from an article or category of articles.",Spring_2020

The purpose of this action is to improve efficient harvest of the halibut resource by 1) decreasing wastage of legal-size halibut discarded in the existing BSAI sablefish pot fishery, and 2) potentially reducing whale depredation of halibut from hook-and-line gear by authorizing the use of pot gear in the halibut IFQ and CDQ fisheries. Currently, halibut are only permitted to be harvested with hook-and-line gear. As part of this action, NMFS would require vessels interested in retaining halibut in pot gear in the BSAI to install and operate Vessel Monitoring Systems and daily fishing logbooks and close the Pribilof Island Habitat Conservation Zone to all fishing with pot gear. In the event that there is a conservation concern for bycatch of shellfish or groundfish species, NMFS would have the authority to close the directed longline and pot halibut fisheries in both the BSAI and the Gulf of Alaska.",Fall_2019

Also, the ""receiver pays"" approach that was generally applicable to domestic shipments in that final rule was not suitable in the export context, as the receiver of exported wastes is a foreign entity. Thus, in this action EPA is pursuing a new regulatory change to address which entity involved in the export supply chain is best suited to submit export manifests to EPA and pay the requisite user fee for the processing of export manifests. This action will also address the several manifest-related reports that are required when there are specific manifested waste shipment problems. The current regulations require the following reports to be submitted in writing: (1) an Exception Report from generators when a signed manifest confirming the receipt of wastes by the designated facility is overdue; (2) a Discrepancy Report from the designated receiving facility when the waste received differs significantly in quantity or type from the waste that the generator indicated was shipped; and (3) an Unmanifested Waste Report from a receiving facility when a shipment arrives at the receiving facility that was not accompanied by a manifest, but should have been tracked with a RCRA manifest. Since much of the manifest information that is the basis for these separate reports will be available and trackable in e-Manifest, this action will pursue certain regulatory changes so that these reports can be transmitted electronically and more efficiently in e-Manifest rather than as separate, written reports.

For example, the standards require the use of mercury thermometers, which are becoming more difficult to acquire due to the use and availability being phased out for environmental, health, and safety concerns. An update to the flash point test methods could allow for the use of commercially available instrumentation and no longer require mercury thermometers. The EPA also proposed to remove the requirements for mercury thermometers in the SW-846 air sampling and stack emissions methods. In addition, the agency proposed to codify existing guidance regarding the regulatory exclusion in the ignitable characteristic for aqueous liquids containing alcohols and proposed to codify existing sampling guidance regarding waste mixtures having multiple phases when determining whether a waste exhibits the ignitability characteristic.

The four source categories are fossil fuel-fired steam generators, fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators, sulfuric acid plants, and nitric acid plants. What EPA specified for SIPs in appendix P to part 51 was, by design, similar to what EPA specified in part 60 NSPS regulations at that time, including the requirement to report excess emissions on a quarterly basis, at a minimum. In 1999, EPA relaxed the reporting frequency for most NSPS from quarterly to semiannual, but didn't change the appendix P to part 51 requirements. As a result, the still-quarterly requirement under appendix P to part 51 is no longer consistent with the NSPS requirements, as originally intended. In this action, EPA would propose to change the part 51 specified required minimum reporting frequency for sources with continuous monitoring systems from quarterly to semiannual. This would allow (but not require) States to reduce, through their SIPs, the required minimum frequency of excess emissions reporting for these four source categories from quarterly to semiannual. This would harmonize the minimum reporting frequency under SIPs with what EPA requires of the same source categories in numerous other, more recent, regulations, e.g., through NSPS (part 60), NESHAP (parts 61 and 63), and the title V operating permits program (parts 70 and 71). Some States assert that quarterly reporting by the affected source categories has proven unnecessary and overly burdensome.

Accordingly, CPM must be considered (1) in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program in areas that are classified attainment or unclassifiable for the 1997 annual secondary, 2008 24-hour primary or secondary, or 2012 annual primary PM2.5 NAAQS or the PM10 NAAQS, and (2) in nonattainment NSR in areas that are nonattainment for any of the PM2.5 or PM10 NAAQS. Stakeholders have expressed concern that source-specific CPM test results obtained with Method 202 could include positive bias that translates into overestimations of emissions. Some of these stakeholder issues involve the quality of reagent chemicals used in the method, while other issues involve equipment preparation or contamination pre- and post-sampling. Such overestimation could inappropriately affect determinations as to whether major source nonattainment NSR or PSD applies to a new source or modification, required air quality impact analyses, and emission offset requirements. The EPA is revising sections of Method 202 including, but not limited to, the proof blank train preparation and recovery requirements in the method and use of the proof and field train blanks. The revisions would address consistency in the execution of Method 202, which has shown wide variation in its implementation, and allow many performance-based options and procedures.",Fall_2019
Regulatory,"This final rule will address the Agency's residual risk and technology review (RTR) of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities. The Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities NESHAP, subpart FFFFF, was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on May 20, 2003, and subsequently amended on July 13, 2006. The NESHAP established emission limitations and/or work practice requirements based on maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from iron-making blast furnaces; steel-making oxygen furnaces; ancillary operations, such as ladling, hot metal transfer, skimming, and desulfurization; and sinter plants. The HAP emitted from iron and steel sources include metal HAP (all sources) and volatile HAP (sinter plant only). This action implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). The statute directs the EPA to promulgate emission standards under CAA 112(f)(2), within 8 years after the MACT standards were established, if such standards are required to ensure the risks due to HAP emissions from these facilities are acceptable and that the NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect. CAA section 112(d)(6) requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes, and control technologies, no less often than every 8 years. Pursuant to a court order, the EPA is obligated to complete the final action by March 13, 2020.

The HAP emitted by MSW landfills include, but are not limited to, vinyl chloride, ethyl benzene, toluene and benzene. This action implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). The statute directs the EPA to promulgate emission standards under CAA 112(f)(2) if such standards are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect.

Deregulatory,"In 1997, the EPA promulgated a final rule under section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to establish the notification procedures for review of certain new microorganisms before they are introduced into commerce. ""New"" microorganisms are those formed by deliberate combinations of genetic material from organisms classified in different taxonomic genera. This review process is designed to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The rule also established TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemptions from full reporting when 10 specific microorganisms are used as the recipient microorganisms for the introduced genetic material and placed requirements on these recipient microorganisms, the introduced genetic material, and the physical containment (40 CFR 725, subpart G). The rule established a mechanism (40 CFR 725.67) for the public to petition the Agency to propose additional recipient microorganisms for such exemptions. Those regulations also described the appropriate supporting information that must be submitted with the petition to provide the EPA with a starting point for determining whether the recipient should be listed as a candidate for the tiered exemption. The EPA received petitions to add Trichoderma reesei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms that may be used as recipient microorganisms in order to qualify for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms that are being manufactured (defined by statute to include import) for introduction into commerce. Based on the EPA's evaluation of these petitions, the EPA made a preliminary determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism, provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met, and issued a proposed rule.

Specifically, EPA proposed to amend the SNUR for LCPFAC chemical substances by designating as a significant new use manufacturing (including importing) or processing of an identified subset of LCPFAC chemical substances for any use that will not be ongoing after December 31, 2015, and all other LCPFAC chemicals substances for which there are currently no ongoing uses. EPA also proposed to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import LCPFAC chemical substances as part of articles. In addition, EPA proposed to amend a SNUR for perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS) chemical substances that would make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import PFAS chemical substances as part of carpets. Persons subject to these SNURs would be required to notify the EPA at least 90 days before commencing such manufacture or processing. The required notifications would initiate EPA's evaluation of the intended use within the applicable review period. Manufacture and processing for the significant new use would be unable to commence until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and taken such actions as are required in association with that determination. EPA is developing a supplemental proposal for the LCPFAC SNUR amendments to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import a subset of LCPFAC chemical substances as part of certain articles. This supplemental proposal is intended to be responsive to the article consideration provision in TSCA section 5(a)(5), that was added with the 2016 amendments to TSCA and which states that articles can be subject to notification requirements as a significant new use provided that EPA makes an affirmative finding in a rule that there is reasonable potential for exposure to a chemical from an article or category of articles.",Fall_2019

The rule affirming that a small business in another SBA program can qualify as SDVO (125.16) is unnecessary because there is nothing to the contrary. The rules in 125.19 stating that an SDVO small business is not entitled to a contract 125.19 and in 125.20 that a contracting officer decides on the method of competition are also unnecessary because they do not implement, interpret, or prescribe any law or policy.",Fall_2019

These regulations describe the process for applying for various EDA grants under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 or the Trade Act of 1974, and the evaluation and selection criteria EDA will apply when reviewing those applications.  Portions of these regulations are more appropriately communicated to potential applicants through an EDA Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) which specifically addresses the program requirements for applying for grants in a particular fiscal year that may change from year to year to reflect Administration priorities or changing economic circumstances.  Moreover, those interested in the specific requirements of such grants generally know to review grants.gov for those requirements rather than the regulations.  EDA proposes to retain those portions of these regulations that direct applicants to look to the NOFO for specific requirements and that establish certain procedural steps that require regulations (e.g., EDA does not accept appeals of denied applications and limits on indirect costs).

Large whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries and mortalities still occur at levels that, for North Atlantic right whales, exceed the levels established by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Therefore, NMFS believes modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) are needed to meet the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Currently the plan has two seasonal trap/pot closures: Massachusetts Restricted Area and the Great South Channel Trap/Pot Closure. NMFS is acting on the 2003 Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (Team) and 2018 Team working group recommendations to investigate the feasibility of opening current closed trap/pot areas to experimental trap/pot fisheries that would use buoy lineless fishing gear, except during gear retrieval. By opening these areas in this limited way, it is expected that a portion of previously excluded fishermen will regain access to fishing grounds therefore increasing their revenue while helping increase incentives to develop practical buoy lineless gear technologies and techniques that are economically feasible. These technologies and techniques will provide long-term options for helping reduce large whale entanglements in the future.",Fall_2018

Under the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service exercises broad discretion when determining how it implements Commission decisions, such as purse seine fishing restrictions. The National Marine Fisheries Service intends to examine the potential impacts of the domestic implementation of Commission decisions, such as purse seine fishing restrictions, on the economies of the U.S. territories that participate in the Commission, and examine the connectivity between the activities of U.S.-flagged purse seine fishing vessels and the economies of the territories. Based on that and other information, the National Marine Fisheries Service might propose regulations that mitigate adverse economic impacts of purse seine fishing restrictions on the U.S. territories and/or that, in the context of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention), recognize that one or more of the U.S. territories have their own purse seine fisheries that are distinct from the purse seine fishery of the United States and that are consequently subject to special provisions of the Convention and of Commission decisions.",Fall_2018

It also provides authority to implement two new international agreements under the Antigua Convention, which amends the Convention for the establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (Port State Measures Agreement), which restricts the entry into U.S. ports by foreign fishing vessels that are known to be or are suspected of engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. This proposed rule will also implement the Port State Measures Agreement. To that end, this proposed rule will require the collection of certain information from foreign fishing vessels requesting permission to use U.S. ports. It also includes procedures to designate and publicize the ports to which foreign fishing vessels may seek entry and procedures for conducting inspections of these foreign vessels accessing U.S. ports. Further, the rule establishes procedures for notification of: the denial of port entry or port services for a foreign vessel, the withdrawal of the denial of port services if applicable, the taking of enforcement action with respect to a foreign vessel, or the results of any inspection of a foreign vessel to the flag nation of the vessel and other competent authorities as appropriate.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"The Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, Tribal Government, petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to revise the regulations governing the subsistence use of northern fur seals on St. Paul Island, Alaska (subsistence harvest regulations). The Fur Seal Act prohibits all taking of northern fur seals, and authorizes taking of fur seals for subsistence uses if in accordance with regulation. The current regulations limit the taking of northern fur seals to Alaska Natives who reside on the Pribilof Islands (Pribilovians) if it is for subsistence uses and not accomplished in a wasteful manner. The regulations further limit the number of fur seals to be taken annually, and the regulations dictate the size, age, and sex of fur seals, as well as when, where, and how fur seals may be harvested. After reviewing public comments on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, NMFS will proceed with rulemaking to revise the current subsistence harvest regulations consistent with statutory obligations. Potential revisions to these regulations could include, but are not limited to a reduction in regulatory provisions and an increase in cooperative management provisions with the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island. A revision could allow Aleuts to restore subsistence traditions prohibited by the Government since 1890.",Fall_2018

This action proposes to designate the fish released as nonessential experimental populations under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. The proposed nonessential experimental populations are not expected to have a significant impact because the section 7(a)(2) consultation requirement would not apply to Federal agency actions affecting the experimental populations. Additionally, take that is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and is not willful, knowing, or due to negligence would not be prohibited. Otherwise lawful activities include, but are not limited to, agricultural, water management, power generation, construction, recreation, fishing, or forestry practices, when such activities are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Similarly, take caused by any activity taken pursuant to a permit issued by NMFS under section 10 of the Endangered Species Act would not be prohibited.

Deregulatory,"The Southeast Fisheries Science Center regularly tests and approves new types of sea turtle release gear for commercial and charter/headboat vessels with federal Gulf of Mexico reef fish permits. However, all such new types of gear must be added to the list of approved gear in the Code of Federal Regulations before their use satisfies the associated regulatory requirements. Currently in the Gulf of Mexico region, adding new types of sea turtle release gear to the list of approved gear in the regulations requires an amendment to the relevant Council Fishery Management Plan. This lengthy process is not conducive to promoting flexibility or the rapid adoption of new release devices within the fishery. This rule would add three newly approved sea turtle release devices to the regulations as options to fulfill the requirements for carrying sea turtle release gear. It would also modify the framework procedure to allow new types of sea turtle and other protected resources release gear and handling requirements to be approved for use without a full amendment to the fishery management plan.

Regulatory,"The proposed action would revise the designation of critical habitat for the endangered Southern Resident killer whale distinct population segment, pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. Critical habitat for this population is currently designated within inland waters of Washington. In response to a 2014 petition, NMFS is proposing to expand the designation to include areas occupied by Southern Resident killer whales in waters along the U.S. West Coast. Impacts from the designation would stem mainly from Federal agencies' requirement to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, permit (authorize), or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of a listed species. Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to the currently designated critical habitat in inland waters of Washington, but consultation would be newly required for actions affecting the expanded critical habitat areas. Federal agencies are also already required to consult within the Southern Resident killer whales' range (including along the U.S. West Coast) to ensure that any action they carry out, permit, or fund will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species; this requirement would not change with a revision to the critical habitat designation.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This action would clarify the authority of regional fishery management councils and NMFS to regulate aquaculture in the U.S. exclusive economic zone under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). Aquaculture is considered ""fishing"" and thus subject to regulation under the MSA through fishery management plans if the fishery (i.e., fishing for stocks) requires conservation and management. In addition, the MSA and its implementing regulations provide a notification process for new fishing gears or fisheries. The action would describe the regulatory status of aquaculture under approved fishery management plans and identify the process that regional fishery management councils and NMFS could use to regulate aquaculture in the future. This action may also update and clarify the notification process under 50 CFR 600.747, if needed. This action is expected to benefit individuals that are considering development of an aquaculture operation in the U.S. exclusive economic zone and participants in Federal fisheries by ensuring that it is not inadvertently prohibited through clarifying 1) its current status and 2) the process for its future development in the U.S. exclusive economic zone under the authority of the MSA and other applicable law.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"The New England Fishery Management Council developed Framework Adjustment 6 to the Northeast Skate Complex Fishery Management Plan. The Fishery Management Plan manages a complex of seven skate species which are harvested in two different fisheries: One for food (wing fishery) and one for lobster bait (bait fishery). Fishery specific total allowable landings and possession limits are set as part of an annual review and specifications process. The purpose and need of Framework 6 is to minimize the likelihood of incidental possession limits being triggered to prolong the duration of the fishing year for both the wing and bait fisheries and support their shoreside infrastructure. To address this purpose and need, Framework 6 proposes to reduce the management uncertainty buffer between the annual catch limit and the annual catch target from 25 percent to 10 percent. If approved, this will result in increasing the 2018 fishing year total allowable landings from that proposed in Framework 5 from 13,157 mt to 15,788 mt.",Fall_2018

The three distinct population segments of humpback whales concerned - the Mexico, Central American, and Western Pacific distinct population segments - were listed under the Endangered Species Act on September 8, 2016, thereby triggering the requirement under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. Proposed critical habitat for these three distinct population segments of humpback whales will include marine habitats within the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea and will likely overlap with several existing designations, including critical habitat for leatherback sea turtles, North Pacific right whales, Steller sea lions, southern resident killer whales, and the southern distinct population segment of green sturgeon. Impacts from the designations for humpback whales would stem from the statutory requirement for Federal agencies to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, authorize, or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of humpback whale critical habitat. Within many of the areas we are evaluating for potential proposal as critical habitat for the humpback whales distinct population segments, Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to currently designated critical habitat for other listed species.

Amendment 13 would also re-establish the procedure for an enhanced cooperative management system to provide Florida a mechanism to propose regulations concerning spiny lobster directly to NMFS for implementation. Further, this implementing action for Amendment 13 would modify the spiny lobster Federal regulations by updating outdated language and the incorporation by reference of the relevant Florida state regulations. The need for Amendment 13 is to effectively manage and enforce the harvest of spiny lobster to prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield.

Deregulatory,"This action would implement a regulatory amendment to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan to allow Pacific whiting vessels the option to use electronic monitoring (video cameras and associated sensors) in place of observers to meet requirements for 100-percent observer coverage. Vessels participating in the catch share program are required to carry an observer on all trips to ensure total accountability for at-sea discards. For some vessels, electronic monitoring may have lower costs than observers and a reduced logistical burden.

This rule would eliminate the need to file the paper Form I-418 in most cases. This will result in an opportunity cost savings for vessel operators as well as a reduction in their printing and storage costs. CBP no longer needs this information as it is receiving it from the Coast Guard.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"The CBP regulations at 19 CFR 14.4 pertain to the declaration, entry, and dutiable status of repair expenditures made abroad for certain vessels. Specifically, section 4.14 provides that when a vessel subject to the vessel repair statute first arrives into the United States or Puerto Rico following a foreign voyage, the owner, master, or authorized agent must submit a vessel repair declaration to CBP. The CBP port of arrival in turn must forward such a declaration to the Vessel Repair Unit (VRU). In addition, the owner, master or authorized agent/vessel operator must also file a vessel repair entry with the VRU. Under the current version of section 4.14, the owner, master, or authorized agent files the entry at Â one of three VRU ports of entry (New York, NY; San Francisco, CA; and New Orleans, LA), based on the vesselâ€™s port of arrival. However, owing to a steady decrease in the number of entries filed and, other factors, VRU operations have been consolidated to a single port of entry, New Orleans, LA. Therefore, in current practice, the vessel owner, master, or authorized agent/vessel operator files the vessel repair entry at the VRU in New Orleans. The regulation, as it stands, is therefore obsolete and creates confusion for both the agencyâ€™s operations and the regulated public, because it lists three VRUs when there is only one and potentially results in some declarations or entries going to the wrong location. The final rule will streamline CBP regulations to reflect this consolidation.",Fall_2018

Since that time, requirements for the protection of SSI have been modified by a subsequent IFR (2005) and regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), TSA, and Department of Homeland Security.

TSA also issued a fee notice on April 13, 2009. This regulation requires flight schools to notify TSA when aliens, and other individuals designated by TSA, apply for flight training or recurrent training. TSAÂ is consideringÂ a final rule that would change the frequency of security threat assessments from a high-frequency event-based interval to a time-based interval, clarify the definitions and other provisions of the rule, and enable industry to use TSA-provided electronic recordkeeping systems for all documents required to demonstrate compliance with the rule.",Fall_2018

HUDâ€™s regulations implementing the requirements of Section 3 have not been updated since 1994 and are not as effective at promoting economic opportunity for low-income persons as HUD believes they could be.Â  This proposed rule would update HUDâ€™s Section 3 regulations to streamline reporting requirements by aligning the reporting with standard business practice; amending the applicability section; updating reporting and adding new outcome benchmarks; and integrating Section 3 into program enforcement.

Title VI of the TSCA requires that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is responsible for administering the TSCA, promulgate a final rule to implement Formaldehyde Emission Standards for Composite Wood Products. Â Title VI also requires HUD to update its formaldehyde emission standards in section 3280.308 not later than 180 days after the EPAâ€™s promulgation of formaldehyde regulations, to reflect the standards established by section 601 of the TSCA. This proposed rule would update 24 CFR 3280 and 24 CFR 3282 to ensure consistency with the EPAâ€™s regulations implementing section 601 of the TSCA.Â  In addition, the rule proposes to remove provisions in 24 CFR part 3280 requiring the Formaldehyde Health Notice to be displayed in each new manufactured home, and requiring re-certification and testing of plywood and particleboard.",Fall_2018

The rule provides for requirements for lenders to obtain approval under the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval Process (DELRAP) authority for condominiums, and for standards that projects must meet to be approved for mortgage insurance on individual units. The rule provides for flexibility with respect to the concentration of FHA-insured units, owner-occupied units, and the amount that can be set aside for commercial and non-residential space. This will enable HUD to vary these standards, within parameters, to meet market needs.",Fall_2018

Deregulatory,"This rule will revise Categories I, II, and III of the United States Munitions List to include those items that provide the United States with a critical military or intelligence advantage or otherwise warrant control at the highest level. Removed from Category I and III are commercially available firearms and ammunition, which in most cases are available for purchase at retail establishments across the United States and around the world. These firearms and ammunition, as well as other items removed from the United States Munitions List, will continue to be controlled for export under the Commerce Control List of the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce. Transition from control under the United States Munitions List to the Commerce Control List will result in a net reduction in regulatory burden for the affected manufacturing and export community. Under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, U.S. manufacturers and exporters of defense articles on the United States Munitions List are required to register with the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and pay an annual registration fee. Under the Export Administration Regulations, there is no comparable registration requirement or fee for items on the Commerce Control List.

This rulemaking would also allow airlines to provide a mandatory printed notice regarding passengers' rights in an oversales situation by electronic means.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would define the phrase ""unfair or deceptive practice"" found in the Department's aviation consumer protection statute. The Department's statute is modeled after a similar statute granting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the authority to regulate unfair or deceptive practices. Using the FTC's policy statements as a guide, the Department has found a practice to be unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial harm, the harm cannot reasonably be avoided, and the harm is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. Likewise, the Department has found a practice to be deceptive if it misleads or is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances with respect to a material issue (one that is likely to affect the consumer's decision with regard to a product or service). This rulemaking would codify the Department's existing interpretation of ""unfair or deceptive practice"" and seek comment on whether any changes are needed. The rulemaking is not expected to impose monetary costs, and will benefit regulated entities by providing a clearer understanding of the Department's interpretation of the statute.",Fall_2018

Regulatory,"This rulemaking would apply the flight, duty, and rest requirements for domestic, flag and supplemental operations to ferry flights that follow domestic, flag or supplemental all-cargo operations. A ferry flight that follows a domestic, flag or supplemental all-cargo operation would be subject to the same flight, duty, and rest rules as the all-cargo operation it follows. This rule is necessary as it would make part 121 flight, duty, and rest limits applicable to tail-end ferry flights that follow an all-cargo flight.",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"This rulemaking would implement a Pilot Records Database as required by Public Law 111-216 (Aug. 1, 2010). Section 203 amends the Pilot Records Improvement Act by requiring the FAA to create a pilot records database that contains various types of pilot records. These records would be provided by the FAA, air carriers, and other persons who employ pilots. The FAA must maintain these records until it receives notice that a pilot is deceased. Air carriers would use this database to perform a record check on a pilot prior to making a hiring decision.",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"This rulemaking would add specific requirements for proponents who wish to construct meteorological evaluation towers at a height of 50 feet above ground level (AGL) up to 200 feet AGL to file notice of construction with the FAA.

Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would revise the operation of experimental light sport aircraft. The current regulations prohibit the use of these aircraft for flight training for compensation or hire, which, if allowed, would increase safety. This action would remove the restriction that currently prevents flight training and allow for it under the existing FAA letter of deviation authority authorization process.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,This rulemaking would revise regulations that impose a duplicative requirement on foreign applicants for type certificates of import products. Existing FAA regulations require all applicants to submit two documents: a compliance listing to document the means of compliance with applicable standards; and a corresponding compliance certification from the applicant certifying that all the requirements in the certification basis have been complied with. These compliance statements are duplicative and redundant to the certifying statement that the FAA already requires from the foreign civil aviation authority of the country or jurisdiction having State of Design responsibility for the design approval holder of the product. This rulemaking would no longer require either the compliance listing or the accompanying compliance certification from the foreign applicant.,Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This action would allow non-structural walls (partitions) to collapse if they are immediately adjacent to a sudden hole in the fuselage skin of a size that would cause a rapid decompression. Compliance to the rule as written would require substantial structural strength for these small compartments, and could create unintended, unsafe consequences for the airframe structure, such as the floor beams, if these partitions were strengthened. Certification to the revised standard would allow partitions to collapse in a controlled manner and in a way that continues to protect the occupants from contact and injury to the extent practical.",Fall_2018

Deregulatory,The FAA is proposing to revise its rules for airworthiness directives (AD) to expand who has the authority to approve an alternative method of compliance (AMOC). The current regulations limit this authority to the manager of the office identified in the AD. The proposed ruleÂ would reduce the number of AMOCs required to be approved by the FAA and would expedite certain AMOC approvals that do need FAA approval. The proposed rule would expand the authority to include any entity identified in the AD. The proposed rule would also remove a section that does not contain any requirements.,Fall_2018
Deregulatory,This action would align the pilot training tasks and authorized Flight Simulation Training Device (FSTD) levels used in air carrier training programs to the technical FSTD qualification standards that are defined in part 60.

This action would also harmonize Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) practices with those of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This action would fundamentally change how the FAA licenses launches and reentries in 14 CFR Chapter III by proposing a regulatory approach that relies on performance-based regulations rather than prescriptive regulations. This action would primarily consolidate and revise parts 415, 417, 431, and 435 into a single regulatory part that states safety objectives to be achieved for the launch of suborbital and orbital expendable and reusable launch vehicles, and the reentry of reentry vehicles, and will leave design or operational solutions up to the applicant. This action will be accompanied by a body of Advisory Circulars or standards that collectively provide at least one acceptable means of compliance for all performance-based regulations in the new part. This action would also enable flexible timeframes, remove unnecessary ground safety regulations, redefine when launch begins to allow specified pre-flight operations prior to license approval, and allow applicants to seek a license to launch from multiple sites. This proposal would significantly streamline and simplify licensing of launch and reentry operations, enable novel operations, and result in net cost savings.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This action would codify current statutory requirements mandated by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 (CSLCA), and provide greater clarity to affected industry and the public. Specifically, this rulemaking would update definitions relating to commercial space launch and reentry vehicles and occupants, as well as implement clarifications to financial responsibility requirements. In addition, CSLCA would enable commercial space applicants to retain experimental permits despite issuance of a license.This rulemaking would update FAA regulations to be consistent with current statutory requirements under CSLCA. In doing so, this rulemaking would provide increased clarity for industry and other stakeholders, such as applicants seeking licenses for space flight operations involving government astronauts, currently required to adhere to the statute, resulting in a possible cost savings that will be clarified as the rule develops.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This action would revise the rules for aircraft maintenance, primarily in the area of aircraft inspections for smaller and corporate-sized aircraft.

Regulatory,"This rulemaking would require certain airport certificate holders to develop, implement, maintain, and adhere to a safety management system (SMS) for its aviation related activities. An SMS is a formalized approach to managing safety by developing an organization-wide safety policy, developing formal methods of identifying hazards, analyzing and mitigating risk, developing methods for ensuring continuous safety improvement, and creating organization-wide safety promotion strategies.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would revise regulations in title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 27 (Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft) and part 29 (Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Rotorcraft) related to the certification of rotorcraft. The proposed changes are necessary due to the extensive application of advancing technologies to rotorcraft. Existing airworthiness standards are inadequate because they do not address increasing design complexity. To address these advances, the FAA currently issues reoccurring special conditions, equivalent level of safety findings (ELOS), and means of compliance (MOC) issue papers. This rulemaking would address these problem areas by updating those standards that cause unnecessary burdens in cost and time to both the FAA and the rotorcraft industry. By updating the affected standards, many special conditions, ELOS findings, and MOC issue papers would be unnecessary, thus reducing the burden and cost on both the FAA and industry",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"This rulemaking would provide an alternative, streamlined and simple, web-based aircraft registration process for the registration of small unmanned aircraft, including small unmanned aircraft operated as model aircraft, to facilitate compliance with the statutory requirement that all aircraft register prior to operation. It would also provide a simpler method for marking small unmanned aircraft that is more appropriate for these aircraft. This action responds to public comments received regarding the proposed registration process in the Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft notice of proposed rulemaking, the request for information regarding unmanned aircraft system registration, and the recommendations from the Unmanned Aircraft System Registration Task Force.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would revise the FAA's requirements for an application to operate in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace. This rulemaking would eliminate the requirement for operators to apply for a RVSM authorization when their aircraft: 1) meet current altitude-keeping performance requirements for operations in RVSM airspace and 2) are equipped with qualified Automatic Dependent Surveillance â€“ Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) systems. Currently, operators must apply for and receive authorization from the FAA prior to operating in RVSM airspace by submitting detailed information on its compliance with RVSM operations. Aircraft equipped with qualified ADS-B Out systems, however, transmit the necessary altitude information to allow the FAA to perform continual monitoring of aircraft height-keeping performance necessary for safe operations. This rulemaking responds to requests to eliminate the burden and expense of the current RVSM application process for operators of aircraft equipped with qualified ADS-B Out systems.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"This rulemaking would allow pilots with partÂ 121 pilot in command (PIC) experience prior to July 31, 2013, but who were not serving as a PIC on the date, to count that time towards the 1,000 hours of air carrier experience required to serve as a PIC in part 121 today.",Fall_2018
Deregulatory,"The purpose of this rulemaking is to remove the requirement that all aircraft equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) must transmit at all times. This rule provides an exception to ADS-B requirements, removing the transmission requirement for certain operations carried out in the interest of national security. The changes would provide relief to those government agencies that operate aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out but require the ability to terminate the transmission signal when conducting national security, sensitive, intelligence and law enforcement missions that could be compromised by the requirement to transmit flight information over non-encrypted signals.",Fall_2018

The increased wet weather flows can exceed the POTW treatment plant's capacity to provide the same type of treatment for all of the incoming wastewater. The treatment plant's secondary treatment units are the most likely to be adversely affected by wet weather because the biological systems can be damaged when too much water flows through them. POTWs employ a variety of operational practices to ensure the integrity of their secondary treatment units during wet weather. This update to the regulations will seek to clarify permitting procedures so as to provide POTWs with separate sanitary sewer systems flexibility in how they manage and treat peak flows under wet weather conditions.

Regulatory,"The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) reduces risks to drinking water consumers from lead and copper that can enter drinking water as a result of corrosion of plumbing materials. The LCR requires water systems to sample at taps in homes with leaded plumbing materials. Depending upon the sampling results, water systems must take actions to reduce exposure to lead and copper including corrosion control treatment, public education and lead service line replacement. The LCR was promulgated in 1991 and, overall, has been effective in reducing the levels of lead and copper in drinking water systems across the country. However, lead crises in Washington, DC, and Flint, Michigan, and the subsequent national attention focused on lead in drinking water in other communities, have underscored significant challenges in the implementation of the current rule, including a rule structure that, for many systems, only compels protective actions after public health threats have been identified. Key challenges include the rule's complexity; the degree of flexibility and discretion it affords systems and primacy states with regard to optimization of corrosion control treatment; compliance sampling practices, which in some cases may not adequately protect from lead exposure; and limited specific focus on key areas of concern such as schools. There is a compelling need to modernize and strengthen implementation of the rule--to strengthen its public health protections and to clarify its implementation requirements to make it more effective and more readily enforceable.",Fall_2018

Deregulatory,"Water, including drinking water, waste water and storm water; is handled by a system of pipes which deliver water to residences; commercial, institutional and industrial users; transfer waste water from users to wastewater treatment plants; and carry untreated storm water to streams and lakes. Existing water pipes of all types run beneath and beside major roadways, beneath buildings and overlap other utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, cable); their replacement can potentially be problematic, especially in high density residential, industrial and urban areas. Even replacement in suburban and rural areas can require careful navigation beneath roadways and other major structures. As the infrastructure of municipalities age, utilities serving the population need to replace deteriorated water pipes. Existing water pipes can be made of various components such as clay, iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), concrete and asbestos cement (A/C). These A/C pipes are potentially subject to regulation under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Asbestos (Asbestos NESHAP) when replaced. The Asbestos NESHAP sets work practice standards designed to minimize releases of asbestos to protect human health. The Agency received a request to approve a new alternative work practice (AWP) for the replacement of A/C pipes that is done using a trenchless technique called close tolerance pipe slurrification (CTPS).

Deregulatory,"In 1997, the EPA promulgated a final rule under section 5 of Toxic Substances and Control Act (TSCA) to establish the notification procedures for review of certain ""New"" microorganisms before they are introduced into commerce. Â‘Â‘New microorganisms are those formed by deliberate combinations of genetic material from organisms classified in different taxonomic genera. This review process is designed to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The rule also established TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemptions from full reporting when 10 specific microorganisms are used as the recipient microorganisms for the introduced genetic material and placed requirements on these recipient microorganisms, the introduced genetic material, and the physical containment (40 CFR 725, subpart G). The rule established a mechanism (40 CFR 725.67) for the public to petition the Agency to propose additional recipient microorganisms for such exemptions. Those regulations also described the appropriate supporting information that must be submitted with the petition to provide the EPA with a starting point for determining whether the recipient should be listed as a candidate for the tiered exemption. The EPA received petitions to add Trichoderma reesei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms that may be used as recipient microorganisms in order to qualify for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms that are being manufactured (defined by statute to include import) for introduction into commerce. Based on the EPA's evaluation of these petitions, the EPA made a preliminary determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met and issued a proposed rule. After considering comments on its proposed exemption, the EPA is developing a revised proposal that will address the concerns raised by the commenters, and is considering expanding the earlier proposal to prohibit the inclusion of antibiotic resistance genes in the introduced genetic material in microorganisms qualifying for the TSCA 5(h)(4) exemption.",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"As part of EPA's continuing efforts to implement the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) with immediate effect upon its enactment on June 22, 2016, EPA is developing a proposed rule to implement TSCA section 6(h). TSCA section 6(h) directs EPA to issue regulations under section 6(a) for certain persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances that were identified in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan. These regulations must be proposed by June 22, 2019, and issued in final form no later than eighteen months after proposal. Section 6(h) further directs EPA, in selecting among the available prohibitions and other restrictions in TSCA section 6(a), to address risks of injury to health or the environment that the Administrator determines are presented by the chemical substances and reduce exposure to the chemical substances to the extent practicable. EPA must develop an exposure and use assessment, but the statute explicitly states that a risk evaluation is not required for these chemical substances. EPA has identified five chemical substances for proposed action under TSCA section 6(h). These chemical substances are: decabromodiphenyl ether; hexachlorobutadiene; pentachlorothiophenol; phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1), also known as tris(4-isopropylphenyl) phosphate; and 2,4,6-tris(tert-butyl)phenol. Decabromodiphenyl ether is a flame retardant that has been widely used in textiles, plastics, adhesives and polyurethane foam. Hexachlorobutadiene is produced as a byproduct in the production of chlorinated solvents and has also been used as an absorbent for gas impurity removal and as an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber compounds. Pentachlorothiophenol is also used in the manufacture of rubber compounds. Phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) is a flame retardant and is also used in lubricants and hydraulic fluids and in the manufacture of other compounds. 2,4,6-Tris(tert-butyl)phenol is an antioxidant that can be used as a fuel or lubricant and as an intermediate in the manufacture of other compounds.",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"EPA is reviewing existing regulatory dust-lead hazard standards for target housing and Child Occupied Facilities (COFs), and the definition of lead-based paint for non-target housing. On March 6, 1996, the EPA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a joint final regulation that, under section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), adopted the statutory definition of lead-based paint as ""paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 milligram per square centimeter or 0.5 percent by weight."" On January 5, 2001, EPA issued a final regulation that, under section 403 of the TSCA, established regulatory dust-lead hazard standards of 40 Âµg/ft2 for floors and 250 Âµg/ft2 for interior window sills. On August 10, 2009, EPA received a petition requesting that EPA take action to lower EPA's regulatory dust-lead hazard standards and the definition of lead-based paint. On October 22, 2009, EPA responded to the petition, agreeing to initiate a proceeding to determine whether the dust-lead hazard standards, and the definition of lead-based paint for non-target housing should be revised. On August 24, 2016, advocates filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the court to compel EPA to make these revisions. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on July 2, 2018, and was issued in compliance with the December 27, 2017, decision of the Ninth Circuit, and the subsequent March 26, 2018, order that directed the EPA ""to issue a proposed rule within ninety (90) days from the filed date of this order."" Scientific advances made since the promulgation of the 2001 rule clearly demonstrate that exposure to low levels of lead result in adverse health effects. Moreover, since CDC has stated that no safe level of lead in blood has been identified, the reductions in children's blood lead levels as a result of this rule would help reduce the risk of adverse cognitive and developmental effects in children. Therefore, EPA proposed to change the dust-lead hazard standards from 40 Âµg/ft2 and 250 Âµg/ft2 to 10 Âµg/ft2 and 100 Âµg/ft2 on floors and window sills, respectively. These standards apply to most pre-1978 housing and child-occupied facilities, such as day care centers and kindergarten facilities. In addition, EPA proposed to make no change to the definition of lead-based paint because the Agency currently lacks sufficient information to support such a change.",Fall_2018
Regulatory,"Section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act provides authority for EPA to ban or restrict the manufacture (including import), processing, distribution in commerce, and use of chemical substances, as well as any manner or method of disposal.

Methylene chloride is used in paint and coating removal in commercial processes and consumer products. In the August 2014 TSCA Work Plan Chemical Risk Assessment for methylene chloride, EPA characterized risks from use of these chemicals in paint and coating removal. On January 19, 2017, EPA preliminarily determined that the use of methylene chloride in paint and coating removal poses an unreasonable risk of injury to health. EPA also proposed prohibitions and restrictions on the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of methylene chloride for all consumer and most types of commercial paint and coating removal and on the use of methylene chloride in commercial paint and coating removal in specified sectors. While EPA proposed to identify the use of methylene chloride in commercial furniture refinishing as presenting an unreasonable risk, EPA intends to further evaluate the commercial furniture refinishing use and develop an appropriate regulatory risk management approach under the process for risk evaluations for existing chemicals under TSCA. Although N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was included in the January 2017 proposed rule, EPA intends to address NMP use in paint and coating removal in the risk evaluation for NMP and to consider any resulting risk reduction requirements in a separate regulatory action (RIN 2070-AK46).",Fall_2018

Rather than authorizing new imports through proposed and final rules and specifying import conditions in the regulations, the notice-based process uses Federal Register notices to make risk analyses available to the public for review and comment, with authorized commodities and their conditions of entry subsequently being listed on the Internet. It also will remove the region- or commodity-specific phytosanitary requirements currently found in these regulations. Likewise, we are proposing an equivalent revision of the performance standard in our regulations governing the interstate movements of fruits and vegetables from Hawaii and the U.S. territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the removal of commodity-specific phytosanitary requirements from those regulations. This action willÂ allow for the consideration of requests to authorize the importation or interstate movement of new fruits and vegetables in a manner that enables a more flexible and responsive regulatory approach to evolving pest situations in both the United States and exporting countries.

Under the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service exercises broad discretion when determining how it implements Commission decisions, such as purse seine fishing restrictions. The National Marine Fisheries Service intends to examine the potential impacts of the domestic implementation of Commission decisions, such as purse seine fishing restrictions, on the economies of the U.S. territories that participate in the Commission, and examine the connectivity between the activities of U.S.-flagged purse seine fishing vessels and the economies of the territories. Based on that and other information, the National Marine Fisheries Service might propose regulations that mitigate adverse economic impacts of purse seine fishing restrictions on the U.S. territories and/or that, in the context of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention), recognize that one or more of the U.S. territories have their own purse seine fisheries that are distinct from the purse seine fishery of the United States and that are consequently subject to special provisions of the Convention and of Commission decisions.",Spring_2018

It also provides authority to implement two new international agreements  the Antigua Convention, which amends the Convention for the establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (Port State Measures Agreement), which restricts the entry into U.S. ports by foreign fishing vessels that are known to be or are suspected of engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. This proposed rule will also implement the Port State Measures Agreement. To that end, this proposed rule will require the collection of certain information from foreign fishing vessels requesting permission to use U.S. ports. It also includes procedures to designate and publicize the ports to which foreign fishing vessels may seek entry and procedures for conducting inspections of these foreign vessels accessing U.S. ports. Further, the rule establishes procedures for notification of: the denial of port entry or port services for a foreign vessel, the withdrawal of the denial of port services if applicable, the taking of enforcement action with respect to a foreign vessel, or the results of any inspection of a foreign vessel to the flag nation of the vessel and other competent authorities as appropriate.",Spring_2018

Deregulatory,"The Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, Tribal Government, petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to revise the regulations governing the subsistence use of northern fur seals on St. Paul Island, Alaska (subsistence harvest regulations). The Fur Seal Act prohibits all taking of northern fur seals, and authorizes taking of fur seals for subsistence uses if in accordance with regulation. The current regulations limit the taking of northern fur seals to Alaska Natives who reside on the Pribilof Islands (Pribilovians) if it is for subsistence uses and not accomplished in a wasteful manner. The regulations further limit the number of fur seals to be taken annually, and the regulations dictate the size, age, and sex of fur seals, as well as when, where, and how fur seals may be harvested. After reviewing public comments on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, NMFS will proceed with rulemaking to revise the current subsistence harvest regulations consistent with statutory obligations. Potential revisions to these regulations could include, but are not limited to a reduction in regulatory provisions and an increase in cooperative management provisions with the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island.

Prior to the recent emergency action, the annual catch limit was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014. The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper annual catch limit as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan. In addition, this action will specify a total annual catch limit, a commercial annual catch limit, and a recreational annual catch limit to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.

The CBP port of arrival in turn must forward such a declaration to the Vessel Repair Unit (VRU).

Under the current version of section 4.14, the owner, master, or authorized agent files the entry at Â one of three VRU ports of entry (New York, NY; San Francisco, CA; and New Orleans, LA), based on the vesselâ€™s port of arrival. However, owing to a steady decrease in the number of entries filed and, other factors, VRU operations have been consolidated to a single port of entry, New Orleans, LA. Therefore, in current practice, the vessel owner, master, or authorized agent/vessel operator files the vessel repair entry at the VRU in New Orleans. The regulation, as it stands, is therefore obsolete and creates confusion for both the agencyâ€™s operations and the regulated public, because it lists three VRUs when there is only one and potentially results in some declarations or entries going to the wrong location.

Title IV reauthorizes the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers program through 2021; and it is known as the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA 2015). The regulations governing the TAA program have not been updated since 1994. Since that time, five major reauthorizations have occurred. In addition, a recent reauthorization and reform of the workforce development system, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) (Pub.

All five major TAA reauthorizations were implemented through the use of Operating Instructions issued via Training and Employment Guidance Letters (TEGLs). As a result, the cooperating state agencies must use a combination of outdated regulations and a patchwork of administrative guidance to operate the program. Â Issuing updated regulations will simplify and provide clarity for state operation of the TAA program. Unlike TEGLs, an update to the TAA regulations will provide a legally binding set of rules to guide the worker group certification process at the Federal level, the individual benefit and training authorization process at the state level, and also provide Federal and state courts with the Department's authoritative interpretation of the TAARA 2015.

The authorization to obligate funds under this law expired on May 5, 1991. The 1992-1993 Foreign Relations Authorization Act amended the Hostage Relief Act of 1990 to extend both the period of time during which the benefits were available and the eligibility criteria. In addition, section 302 contained two additional changes with respect to hostages captured in Lebanon. Section 302(a)(3) provided that health and life insurance benefits were available under certain circumstances for the period of the individual's hostage status, plus a 60-month period following the termination of hostage status. Previously, these benefits expired 12 months after the termination of hostage status, which remained the law with respect to hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait. 22 CFR part 193 implemented these statutes and described the classes of persons who could apply for benefits under the Act and the procedures according to which such applications will be processed by the Department of State.

Regulatory,"FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations (49 CFR part 225) require railroads to report certain train accidents that result in damages higher than a specified amount (the ""reporting threshold""). Train accidents that yield damages in excess of the reporting threshold are severe enough in nature that FRA wants to capture specific information about those events and use the collected information to identify safety trends. Without the reporting threshold, or some other parameter, railroads would have to report every minor event. FRA periodically reviews the reporting threshold and adjusts it as necessary to accurately maintain comparability between different years of accident data by having the reporting threshold keep pace with any increases or decreases in equipment and labor costs. This approach ensures that each year train accidents involving the same minimum amount of railroad property damage are included in the reportable accident counts. FRA uses two components to calculate the reporting threshold: (1) Surface Transportation Board (STB) wage data for certain railroad employees; and (2) the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) overall rail equipment cost index (PPI). This rule proposes: (1) a minor technical correction to the mathematical formula (published at appendix B to part 225) FRA uses to periodically adjust the reporting threshold; (2) the use of full-year (12 months) STB wage and PPI equipment price data in the threshold calculation formula (FRA currently uses only 2nd-quarter [3 months] wage and equipment price data in its calculations); and (3) a change in how FRA notifies railroads of adjustments to the reporting threshold.

Deregulatory,"The Federal hazardous materials transportation law requires the Secretary of Transportation to ensure that, to the extent practicable, regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce are consistent with standards adopted by international authorities (49 U.S.C. 5120(b)). Harmonization enhances safety, facilitates compliance, and improves the efficiency of the global transportation system by minimizing the regulatory burden on the public, thus promoting trade. After a thorough review of the provisions recently adopted by various international regulatory bodies, PHMSA has identified areas in the HMR in which harmonization with international regulations will provide an enhanced level of safety, an economic benefit, or in many instances both increased safety and economic benefits. As a result, this rulemaking action would amend the HMR, where appropriate, to maintain alignment with international standards that will become effective as of January 1, 2019, and consequently facilitate the safe global trade of hazardous materials. Proposals in this rulemaking action include, but are not limited to: non-testing methods to classify corrosive materials; a classification scheme and transport provisions for articles containing hazardous materials that do not already have a proper shipping name; a lithium battery test summary document; provisions to recognize one-time movement approvals issued by Transport Canada; and the incorporation by reference of various international standards including the latest editions of the UN Model Regulations, the IMDG Code, the ICAO TI, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) technical standards applicable to cylinders. We expect the regulatory changes will result in minimal compliance costs for the regulated industry; we firmly believe consistent regulatory requirements reduce compliance costs and increase flexibility.",Spring_2018

Regulatory,"The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) reduces risks to drinking water consumers from lead and copper that can enter drinking water as a result of corrosion of plumbing materials. The LCR requires water systems to sample at taps in homes with leaded plumbing materials. Depending upon the sampling results, water systems must take actions to reduce exposure to lead and copper, including corrosion control treatment, public education, and lead service line replacement. The LCR was promulgated in 1991 and, overall, has been effective in reducing the levels of lead and copper in drinking water systems across the country. However, lead crises in Washington, DC, and in Flint, Michigan, and the subsequent national attention focused on lead in drinking water in other communities, have underscored significant challenges in the implementation of the current rule, including a rule structure that, for many systems, only compels protective actions after public health threats have been identified. Key challenges include the rule's complexity; the degree of flexibility and discretion it affords systems and primacy States with regard to optimization of corrosion control treatment; compliance sampling practices, which in some cases, may not adequately protect from lead exposure; and limited specific focus on key areas of concern such as schools. There is a compelling need to modernize and strengthen implementation of the rule--to strengthen its public health protections and to clarify its implementation requirements to make it more effective and more readily enforceable.",Spring_2018

Deregulatory,"In 1997, the EPA promulgated a final rule under section 5 of Toxic Substances and Control Act (TSCA) to establish the notification procedures for review of certain new microorganisms before they are introduced into commerce. Â‘Â‘New' microorganisms are those formed by deliberate combinations of genetic material from organisms classified in different taxonomic genera. This review process is designed to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The rule also established TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemptions from full reporting when 10 specific microorganisms are used as the recipient microorganisms for the introduced genetic material and placed requirements on these recipient microorganisms, the introduced genetic material, and the physical containment (40 CFR 725, subpart G). The rule established a mechanism (40 CFR 725.67) for the public to petition the Agency to propose additional recipient microorganisms for such exemptions. Those regulations also described the appropriate supporting information that must be submitted with the petition to provide the EPA with a starting point for determining whether the recipient should be listed as a candidate for the tiered exemption. The EPA received petitions to add Trichoderma reesei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms that may be used as recipient microorganisms in order to qualify for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms that are being manufactured (defined by statute to include import) for introduction into commerce. Based on the EPA's evaluation of these petitions, the EPA made a preliminary determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met, and issued a proposed rule. After considering comments on its proposed exemption, the EPA is developing a revised proposal that will address the concerns raised by the commenters, and is considering expanding the earlier proposal to prohibit the inclusion of antibiotic resistance genes in the introduced genetic material in microorganisms qualifying for the TSCA 5(h)(4) exemption.",Spring_2018
Regulatory,"EPA is reviewing existing regulatory dust-lead hazard standards for target housing and Child Occupied Facilities (COFs), and the definition of lead-based paint for non-target housing. On March 6, 1996, the EPA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a joint final regulation that, under section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), adopted the statutory definition of lead-based paint as ""paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 milligram per square centimeter or 0.5 percent by weight."" On January 5, 2001, the EPA issued a final regulation that, under section 403 of the TSCA, established regulatory dust-lead hazard standards of 40 Âµg/ft2 for floors and 250 Âµg/ft2 for interior window sills. On August 10, 2009, EPA received a petition requesting that EPA take action to lower EPA's regulatory dust-lead hazard standards and the definition of lead-based paint. On October 22, 2009, EPA granted the petition, agreeing to initiate a proceeding to determine whether the dust-lead hazard standards, and the definition of lead-based paint for non-target housing should be revised. On August 24, 2016, advocates filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the court to compel EPA to make such revisions. On December 27, 2017, the Ninth Circuit granted the petition brought by environmental groups seeking to compel EPA to act upon the rulemaking petition that EPA granted in 2009 concerning the dust-lead hazard standards and the definition of lead-based paint. The decision orders EPA to issue a proposed rule within 90 days of the date that the court's decision becomes final and a final rule within one year of the proposal. Since the 2001 final rule, data collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and other studies, advances in blood lead modeling, and EPA's 2013 release of the Integrated Science Assessment for Lead, have made it possible to examine relationships between environmental lead exposures and blood lead concentrations in children, and to analyze the health effects of that relationship at lower levels. Since new data has become available regarding lead, and other agencies and EPA offices are updating their lead-related policies, EPA's review of the existing dust-lead hazard standards for target housing and COFs and the definition of lead-based paint in non-target housing should reflect this information to maintain consistency with new policies and data.",Spring_2018

Current regulations require permitted Atlantic Tunas Longline vessels to possess a minimum amount of Individual Bluefin Quota to depart on a fishing trip with pelagic longline gear onboard and account for bluefin tuna catch (fish retained or discarded dead) using Individual Bluefin Quota. At the end of a trip on which bluefin tuna are caught, a vessel's Individual Bluefin Quota balance is reduced by the amount caught. If the trip catch exceeds the vessel's available quota, the vessel will incur quota debt (i.e., exceeding its available Individual Bluefin Quota balance). In this case, the regulations currently require the vessel to obtain additional Individual Bluefin Quota through leasing to resolve that quota debt and to acquire the minimum Individual Bluefin Quota amount, before departing on a subsequent trip using pelagic longline gear. This action would implement accountability on a quarterly basis instead of after each trip to minimize constraints on fishing for target species and support business planning while accounting for all bluefin tuna catch and maintaining incentives to avoid bluefin catch. Quarterly accountability would require vessel owners to resolve quota debt and obtain the minimum amount of Individual Bluefin Tuna prior to fishing for the first time during each new calendar quarter. The annual U.S. Bluefin tuna quota would remain unaffected by this measure, as it results from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommendations. Through the proposed rule, NMFS would consider the potential impacts of this approach on the Individual Bluefin Tuna Program.",Fall_2017
Deregulatory,"This administrative action would allow Atlantic highly migratory species charter/headboats that do not sell their catch to obtain a highly migratory species Charter/Headboat permit without the commercial sale provision. Under current highly migratory species regulations, these vessels are permitted to sell their catch if they choose. Recent changes in United States Coast Guard commercial fishing vessel safety policies now classify vessels with this permit as commercial fishing vessels, since they may legally sell their catch. Safety requirements (including life rafts, emergency beacons, survival suits, etc.) for commercial fishing vessels may be overly burdensome for many highly migratory species Charter/Headboat operations. The action would create a separate regulatory provision for Charter/Headboat vessels to sell their highly migratory species catch. As a result, highly migratory species Charter/Headboat permitted vessels that do not sell, nor intend to sell, their highly migratory species catch could obtain the permit required to take fee-paying passengers, without subsequently being classified as a commercial fishing vessel under United States Coast Guard regulations. Charter/headboat vessels without the provision to sell highly migratory species would be subject United States Coast Guard safety regulations for uninspected passenger vessels of less than 100 gross tons and carrying six or less passengers.",Fall_2017
Deregulatory,"The Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, Tribal Government, petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to revise the regulations governing the subsistence use of northern fur seals on St. Paul Island, Alaska (subsistence harvest regulations). The Fur Seal Act prohibits all taking of northern fur seals, and authorizes taking of fur seals for subsistence uses if in accordance with regulation. The current regulations limit the taking of northern fur seals to Alaska Natives who reside on the Pribilof Islands (Pribilovians) if it is for subsistence uses and not accomplished in a wasteful manner. The regulations further limit the number of fur seals to be taken annually, and the regulations dictate the size, age, and sex of fur seals, as well as when, where, and how fur seals may be harvested. The regulations also include provisions for the NMFS to temporarily suspend or terminate the taking of northern fur seals for subsistence uses each year. On January 13, 2017, NMFS published a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the environmental effects of the potential revisions to the subsistence harvest regulations for St. Paul Island. NMFS received public comments on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is preparing responses to those comments. NMFS will proceed with rulemaking to revise the current subsistence harvest regulations consistent with statutory obligations. Potential revisions to these regulations could include, but are not limited to, changes to the timing, duration, or location of authorized subsistence practices and the numbers and age of northern fur seals taken for subsistence uses on St. Paul Island. Revisions could also include a reduction in regulatory provisions and an increase in cooperative management provisions with the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island.

This action would revise the State Waters Exemption Program to allow vessels that hold both a Massachusetts State scallop permit, and either a Limited Access General Category Individual Fishing Quota or Limited Access General Category Northern Gulf of Maine Federal scallop permit, to fish entirely within State waters--once full harvest of the Federal Total Allowable Catch closes the Northern Gulf of Maine Management Area for the remainder of the fishing year. This action would also modify the State Waters Exemption for the State of Maine to include vessels that have both a State scallop permit and a Limited Access General Category Individual Fishing Quota permit. Currently, only Limited Access General Category Northern Gulf of Maine permit holders are part of the exemption in Maine. Vessels would not be exempt from any other Federal restrictions. Because the Northern Gulf of Maine Federal Total Allowable Catch is set based only on the Federal portion of the resource, and both Maine and Massachusetts have a scallop management program in State waters, we do not expect this exemption to compromise the Fishery Management Plan's limits on catch and mortality.",Fall_2017

In the final revised respirator standard, OSHA set up a mechanism for OSHA's acceptance of new fit test protocols under Mandatory Appendix A. Any person may submit to OSHA an application for approval of a new fit test protocol, and if the application meets certain criteria, OSHA will initiate a rulemaking proceeding under 6(b)(7) of the OSH Act to determine whether to list the new protocol as an approved fit test protocol in Appendix A. OSHA has received a submission to consider three new quantitative fit test protocols that reduce the time required to complete the fit test while maintaining acceptable test sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. Employers, employees, and safety and health professionals use fit testing to select respirators. Currently OSHA relies on fit testing methods specified in Appendix A of the final revised Respiratory Protection standard. When OSHA published the final Respiratory Protection standard in 1998, it allowed for later rulemaking on new fit test protocols.

Following publication of the final crane standard, stakeholders informed the Agency that certification did not by itself establish a safe enough level of experience and competence--employers must be responsible to ensure that crane operators are qualified. The Agency responded by publishing a final rule postponing the deadline for operator certification and extending the employer duty to permit the Agency to conduct rulemaking, if necessary, on operatory qualification. This rulemaking will also clarify issues surrounding operatory certification, including the ""type and capacity"" requirement from the 2010 final construction cranes standard. Establishing clear benchmarks for employers to follow to ensure crane operator competence is essential for construction work site safety.

The revised FMVSS is due to take effect on Sept. 1, 2014. Subsequent to the publication of the new FMVSS 122, NHTSA became aware that Motorcycle OEMs are unable to comply with a requirement in the revised standard by the effective date. The requirement at issue is that an ABS failure indicator lamp must be labeled with letters that are 3/32 inches high. Since most current motorcycles will not meet this requirement, the OEMs would incur significant cost to re-manufacture their indicators, and there is insufficient lead time to comply when the new requirement takes effect next year. Most OEMs currently use the ISO symbol, and they suggested this course of action to NHTSA. This rulemaking would allow the use of the ISO symbol as an alternative to meet S5.1.10.2(c) of FMVSS 122, and would make a corresponding amendment to include the ISO symbol in Table 3 of FMVSS 123 since the symbol is not currently identified in any NHTSA standard.",Fall_2017

Regulatory,"The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) reduces risks to drinking water consumers from lead and copper that can enter drinking water as a result of corrosion of plumbing materials. The LCR requires water systems to sample at taps in homes with leaded plumbing materials. Depending upon the sampling results, water systems must take actions to reduce exposure to lead and copper including corrosion control treatment, public education and lead service line replacement. The LCR was promulgated in 1991 and, overall, has been effective in reducing the levels of lead and copper in drinking water systems across the country. However, lead crises in Washington, DC, and in Flint, Michigan, and the subsequent national attention focused on lead in drinking water in other communities, have underscored significant challenges in the implementation of the current rule, including a rule structure that, for many systems, only compels protective actions after public health threats have been identified. Key challenges include the rule's complexity; the degree of flexibility and discretion it affords systems and primacy states with regard to optimization of corrosion control treatment; compliance sampling practices, which in some cases, may not adequately protect from lead exposure; and limited specific focus on key areas of concern such as schools. There is a compelling need to modernize and strengthen implementation of the rule - to strengthen its public health protections and to clarify its implementation requirements to make it more effective and more readily enforceable.

Deregulatory,"States are now required to account for Condensable Particulate Matter (CPM) in establishing emissions limits for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in all applicable Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) permits issued. The NSR regulations require that the measurement and control of PM from major stationary sources and major modifications include the condensable component for both PM2.5 and PM10 emissions. Accordingly, CPM must be considered (1) in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program in areas that are classified attainment or unclassifiable for the 1997 annual secondary, 2008 24-hour primary or secondary or 2012 annual primary PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) or the PM10 NAAQS, and (2) in nonattainment NSR in areas that are nonattainment for any of the PM2.5 or PM10 NAAQS. Stakeholders have expressed concern that source-specific CPM test results obtained with Method 202 could include positive bias that translates into overestimations of emissions. Some of these stakeholder issues involve the quality of reagent chemicals used in the method, while other issues involve equipment preparation or contamination pre- and post-sampling. Such overestimation could inappropriately affect determinations as to whether major source nonattainment NSR or PSD applies to a new source or modification, required air quality impact analyses and emission offset requirements. The EPA is revising sections of Method 202 including, but not limited to, the proof blank train preparation and recovery requirements in the method and use of the proof and field train blanks.

This method describes the minimum procedures that you must use to validate an alternative test method to meet 40 CFR part 63 compliance requirements. This method includes minimum procedures to determine and document systematic error (bias) and random error (precision) of measured concentrations from exhaust gases, wastewater, sludge, and other media. It contains procedures for ensuring sample stability if such procedures are not included in the test method. This method also includes optional procedures for ruggedness and detection limits. The EPA is finalizing revisions to existing Method 301. The revisions include editorial, technical, and consistency changes in the language, tables, and equations of Method 301. Technical revisions include the specification of when certain procedures in Method 301 are required and when they are optional, and consistency changes include a requirement for the same number of samples to be analyzed independent of the approach chosen to validate the alternative method. Other revisions include revising the language for the bias acceptance criteria and adding a correction factor equation for a site specific determination of bias, requiring ruggedness testing and determination of a detection limit when using Method 301 as validation for multiple sources, requiring the same number of samples when using a quadruplicate sampling system or analyte spiking to reduce the amount of uncertainty in statistical calculations, and updating limit of detection procedures to incorporate media specific data. Method 301 was originally published on December 29, 1992 [57 FR 61970], as a field validation protocol method. On March 16, 1994, Method 301 was included in 40 CFR 63.7 [59 FR 12430] to validate alternative test method requests. To date, subsequent revisions of Method 301 have not been changed to distinguish requirements for site-specific applications of the method versus a single validation for multiple sources. The EPA recognized that there were a number of ways Method 301 could be clarified while reviewing submitted data and answering questions from facilities, environmental labs, and technology vendors on the application and requirements of the method. The changes are intended to improve the readability of the method and ensure that required calculations and acceptance criteria for each of Method 301's three validation approaches are clear.

Within 24-hours of a container being accepted, the OSWRO facility must undertake a visual inspection of the container, its cover and closure devices. If containers remain on-site for a period of one year or more, facilities must visually inspect the containers and their closure devices at least once every calendar year that they remain on-site.

In July 2016, when this alternative monitoring method was first published (via a direct final rulemaking), it was believed that hydrogen chloride (HCl) calibration gases would become available within a period of one year (i.e., the rule provides for the use of this alternative monitoring method until July 25, 2017). The calibration gases are needed for compliance demonstrations relative to the HCl continuous monitoring requirements of the Portland Cement Industry final rule. However, as the one-year deadline approached, it became apparent that the calibration gases wound not be widely available for operators, and when the date that the calibration gases would become readily available was uncertain. For this reason, we developed a direct final rule/parallel proposal to extend the alternative monitoring method until such time when the calibration gases became available. (Note that this change will affect only kilns that do not have HCl controls, which are required to continuously monitor for HCl.) The direct final rule/parallel proposal included an alternative method for HCl compliance that requires a yearly stack test along with the HCl monitors performing as parametric monitors instead of direct continuous monitoring. The direct final/parallel proposal was published on June 23, 2017. It was believed that the action would not receive any adverse comment from the public, but on June 29, 2017, we received adverse comment from EarthJustice.

This review process is designed to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The rule also established TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemptions from full reporting when 10 specific microorganisms are used as the recipient microorganisms for the introduced genetic material and placed requirements on these recipient microorganisms, the introduced genetic material, and the physical containment (40 CFR 725, subpart G). The rule established a mechanism (40 CFR 725.67) for the public to petition the Agency to propose additional recipient microorganisms for such exemptions. Those regulations also described the appropriate supporting information that must be submitted with the petition to provide the EPA with a starting point for determining whether the recipient should be listed as a candidate for the tiered exemption. The EPA received petitions to add Trichoderma reesei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms that may be used as recipient microorganisms in order to qualify for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms that are being manufactured (defined by statute to include import) for introduction into commerce. Based on the EPA's evaluation of these petitions, the EPA made a preliminary determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met and issued a proposed rule.

Regulatory,The EPA proposed the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) to include a suite of actions to reduce lead exposure in drinking water where it is needed the most. The proposed rule identifies the most at-risk communities to ensure systems have plans in place to rapidly respond by taking actions to reduce elevated levels of lead in drinking water. The proposed LCR maintains the current Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) of zero and the Action Level of 15 ppb. The proposed rule would require a more comprehensive response at the action level and introduces a trigger level of 10 ppb that requires more proactive planning in communities with lead service lines. The proposed revisions also include requirements for water systems to prepare an inventory of known lead service lines and to make the inventory publicly available. The proposal takes a proactive and holistic approach to improving the current rule -- from testing to treatment to telling the public about the levels and risks of lead in drinking water. This approach focuses on the following six key areas: 1) identifying areas most impacted; 2) strengthening treatment requirements; 3) replacing lead service lines; 4) increasing sampling; 5) improving risk communication; and 6) protecting children in schools.,Fall_2017

Also, the ""receiver pays"" approach that was generally applicable to domestic shipments in that final rule was not suitable in the export context, as the receiver of exported wastes is a foreign entity. Thus, in this action we are proposing a new regulatory change to address which entity involved in the export supply chain is best suited to (1) submit export manifests to EPA and (2) pay the requisite user fee for the processing of export manifests so that exported wastes may be included in the scope of the e-Manifest system. This action will also address the several manifest-related reports that are required when there are specific manifested waste shipment problems. The current regulations require the following reports to be submitted in writing: (1) an Exception Report from generators when a signed manifest confirming the receipt of wastes by the designated facility is overdue; (2) a Discrepancy Report from the designated receiving facility when the waste received differs significantly in quantity or type from the waste that the generator indicated was shipped, and (3) an Unmanifested Waste Report from a receiving facility when a shipment arrives at the receiving facility that was not accompanied by a manifest, but should have been tracked with a manifest required under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Since much of the manifest information that is the basis for these separate reports will be available and trackable in e-Manifest, this action will pursue certain regulatory changes so that these reports can be transmitted electronically and more efficiently in e-Manifest rather than as separate, written reports.

Deregulatory,"This action addresses the agency's residual risk and technology review (RTR) of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Taconite Iron Ore Processing. The Taconite Iron Ore Processing NESHAP, subpart RRRRR, was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on 10/30/03 (68 FR 61867). The NESHAP established emission limitations and/or work practice requirements based on maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing ore crushing and handling operations, indurating furnaces, finished pellet handling operations and ore dryers. The HAP emitted from these sources include metal hazardous air pollutants (e.g., arsenic, nickel, mercury, manganese and lead), acid gases (i.e., hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride) and formaldehyde and other combustion-related gases. This action implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). The statute directs the EPA to promulgate emission standards under CAA 112(f)(2) if such standards are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect. Any such standards are to be promulgated within 8 years after promulgation of MACT standards under CAA section 112(d). CAA section 112(d)(6) requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes and control technologies, no less often than every 8 years. Pursuant to a court order (Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Pruitt, Case No: 1:16-cv-00364 (D.D.C.)) related to the review of 13 source categories, EPA completed seven final RTR actions by December 31, 2018, and the agency must complete six additional RTR actions by June 30, 2020.

Deregulatory,"On December 20, 2018, the EPA proposed revised Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units, found at 40 CFR Part 60, subpart TTTT. The EPA proposed to amend the previous determination that the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for newly constructed coal-fired steam generating units (i.e., EGUs) is partial carbon capture and storage. Instead, the proposed revised BSER for this source category is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle (e.g., supercritical steam conditions for large units and subcritical steam conditions for small units) in combination with the best operating practices.",Fall_2017
Deregulatory,"In this action, EPA intends to update a regulation, appendix P to part 51, promulgated in 1975, specifying what State Implementation Plans (SIPs) must require of sources with continuous monitoring systems for four source categories under which EPA's earliest New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) required new or modified sources to have continuous monitoring systems. The four source categories are fossil fuel-fired steam generators, fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators, sulfuric acid plants, and nitric acid plants. What EPA specified for SIPs in appendix P to part 51 was, by design, similar to what EPA specified in part 60 NSPS regulations at that time, including the requirement to report excess emissions on a quarterly basis, at a minimum. In 1999, EPA relaxed the reporting frequency for most NSPS from quarterly to semiannual, but didn't change the appendix P to part 51 requirements. As a result, the still-quarterly requirement under appendix P to part 51 is no longer consistent with the NSPS requirements, as originally intended. In this action, EPA proposed to change the part 51 specified required minimum reporting frequency for sources with continuous monitoring systems from quarterly to semiannual. This would allow (but not require) states to reduce, through their SIPs, the required minimum frequency of excess emissions reporting for these four source categories from quarterly to semiannual. This would harmonize the minimum reporting frequency under SIPs with what EPA requires of the same source categories in numerous other, more recent, regulations, e.g., through NSPS (part 60), NESHAP (parts 61 and 63), and the title V operating permits program (parts 70 and 71).",Fall_2017

The MON, subpart FFFF, was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on November 10, 2003. The NESHAP controls emissions of HAP from continuous process vents, batch process vents, storage tanks, equipment leaks, wastewater streams, transfer racks and heat exchange systems. The HAP emitted from these sources include, but are not limited to, toluene, methanol, xylene, hydrogen chloride, methylene chloride and ethylene oxide. This action implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). CAA 112(f)(2) directs EPA to revise the NESHAP if such revisions are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect. CAA section 112(d)(6) requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes and control technologies, no less often than every 8 years.

Specifically, EPA proposed to amend the SNUR for LCPFAC chemical substances by designating as a significant new use manufacturing (including importing) or processing of an identified subset of LCPFAC chemical substances for any use that will not be ongoing after December 31, 2015, and all other LCPFAC chemicals substances for which there are currently no ongoing uses. EPA also proposed to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import LCPFAC chemical substances as part of articles. In addition, EPA proposed to amend a SNUR for perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS) chemical substances that would make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import PFAS chemical substances as part of carpets. Persons subject to these SNURs would be required to notify the EPA at least 90 days before commencing such manufacture or processing. The required notifications would initiate EPA's evaluation of the intended use within the applicable review period. Manufacture and processing for the significant new use would be unable to commence until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and taken such actions as are required in association with that determination. In a February 2020 supplemental proposal, EPA proposed to make inapplicable the exemption for persons who import a subset of LCPFAC chemical substances as part of certain articles. The supplemental proposal is intended to be responsive to the article consideration provision in TSCA section 5(a)(5), that was added with the 2016 amendments to TSCA and which states that articles can be subject to notification requirements as a significant new use provided that EPA makes an affirmative finding in a rule that there is reasonable potential for exposure to a chemical from an article or category of articles.",Fall_2017

These regulations describe the process for applying for various EDA grants under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 or the Trade Act of 1974, and the evaluation and selection criteria EDA will apply when reviewing those applications. Portions of these regulations are more appropriately communicated to potential applicants through an EDA Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which specifically addresses the program requirements for applying for grants in a particular fiscal year that may change from year to year to reflect Administration priorities or changing economic circumstances. Moreover, those interested in the specific requirements of such grants generally know to review grants.gov for those requirements rather than the regulations. EDA proposes to retain those portions of these regulations that direct applicants to look to the NOFO for specific requirements and that establish certain procedural steps that require regulations (e.g., EDA does not accept appeals of denied applications and limits on indirect costs). Finally, EDA is proposing to amend the definitions section of the regulations to eliminate the definition of ""Regional Innovation Clusters or RICs."" The term is separately defined in 13 CFR 312.3.

In response to a 2014 petition, NMFS is proposing to expand the designation to include areas occupied by Southern Resident killer whales in waters along the U.S. West Coast. Impacts from the designation would stem mainly from Federal agencies' requirement to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, permit (authorize), or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of a listed species. Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to the currently designated critical habitat in inland waters of Washington, but consultation would be newly required for actions affecting the expanded critical habitat areas. Federal agencies are also already required to consult within the Southern Resident killer whales' range (including along the U.S. West Coast) to ensure that any action they carry out, permit, or fund will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species; this requirement would not change with a revision to the critical habitat designation.",Spring_2019
Deregulatory,"NMFS may modify the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plans Massachusetts Trap/Pot Restricted Area and the Great South Channel Trap/Pot Restricted Area. Large whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries and mortalities still occur at levels that, for North Atlantic right whales, exceed the levels established by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In accordance to recommendations from the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, NMFS believes modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) are needed to meet the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Currently the plan has seasonal trap/pot closures in two areas: Massachusetts Restricted Area and the Great South Channel. This rulemaking would allow trap/pot fishing that does not use vertical buoy lines (referred to as buoy-lineless or ropeless gear) prior to gear retrieval in these areas. By opening these areas to allow this type of gear, it is expected that a portion of previously excluded fishermen will regain access to fishing grounds - potentially leading to revenue increase as well as additional to develop practical and economically feasible buoy lineless gear technologies and techniques. These technologies and techniques will provide long-term options for helping reduce large whale entanglements in the future.",Spring_2019

The three distinct population segments of humpback whales concerned - the Mexico, Central American, and Western Pacific distinct population segments - were listed under the Endangered Species Act on September 8, 2016, thereby triggering the requirement under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. Proposed critical habitat for these three distinct population segments of humpback whales will include marine habitats within the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea and will likely overlap with several existing designations, including critical habitat for leatherback sea turtles, North Pacific right whales, Steller sea lions, southern resident killer whales, and the southern distinct population segment of green sturgeon. Impacts from the designations for humpback whales would stem from the statutory requirement for Federal agencies to consult with NMFS, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to ensure that any action they carry out, authorize, or fund will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of humpback whale critical habitat. Within many of the areas we are evaluating for potential proposal as critical habitat for the humpback whales distinct population segments, Federal agencies are already required to consult on effects to currently designated critical habitat for other listed species.

Deregulatory,"The proposed action would remove regulations at 50 CFR 648.85(b)(7) that implement the Closed Area I Hook Gear Haddock Special Access Program (Haddock SAP). The Haddock SAP was created to allow groundfish vessels following certain gear restrictions to access the groundfish year-round Closed Area I, in order to provide additional fishing opportunities to target healthy stocks. On April 9, 2018, we implemented the Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment (OHA), which eliminated the year-round closure of Closed Area I.  The Haddock SAP is no longer necessary, and, as a result, the geographic area once covered by the program area is now open area, accessible to the groundfish fleet under normal conditions.  Removal of the Haddock SAP is consistent with the OHA, which should have removed measures related to Closed Area I that are no longer necessary.  In addition, removal of unnecessary notification and reporting requirements and restrictions related to the Haddock SAP will help avoid confusion and inconsistencies with other regulations.",Spring_2019

Deregulatory,"Based on the Pacific Fishery Management Council's and NOAA Fisheries 5-year review of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Trawl Catch Share Program, completed in 2017, this rulemaking action proposes to implement the Council's recommendation to adjust the Program. Proposed adjustments are aimed at modifying outdated Program regulations and making the Program more effective, specifically by: changing bycatch hard caps for canary rockfish and widow rockfish in the at-sea whiting sector to set asides; removing the formulas used to determine at-sea whiting sector set-aside amounts of canary rockfish, widow rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, and Pacific ocean perch, and instead determining appropriate amounts through the adaptive biennial harvest specification process; allowing post-season quota trading for vessel accounts in deficit at the end of the year; eliminating the September 1st expiration deadline for unused quota not transferred to a vessel account; setting permit ownership accumulation limits for the whiting Catcher Processor sector; and requiring new economic data collections for Catcher Processor permit owners and quota share owners to better evaluate Catch Share program performance. Similar collections are currently required for the shorebased catcher and at-sea mothership sectors; this action would provide complete economic performance data for all sectors of the Catch Share Program.",Spring_2019

Deregulatory,"In response to the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council's recommendation, this action would allow retention of halibut in pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), provided the operator holds sufficient halibut Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) or Community Development Quota (CDQ) for that IFQ regulatory area. The purpose of this action is to improve efficient harvest of the halibut resource by 1) decreasing wastage of legal-size halibut discarded in the existing BSAI sablefish pot fishery, and 2) potentially reducing whale depredation of halibut from hook-and-line gear by authorizing the use of pot gear in the halibut IFQ and CDQ fisheries. Currently, halibut are only permitted to be harvested with hook-and-line gear. As part of this action, NMFS would require vessels interested in retaining halibut in pot gear in the BSAI to install and operate Vessel Monitoring Systems and daily fishing logbooks and close the Pribilof Island Habitat Conservation Zone to all fishing with pot gear. In the event that there is a conservation concern for bycatch of shellfish or groundfish species, NMFS would have the authority to close the directed longline and pot halibut fisheries in both the BSAI and the Gulf of Alaska.",Spring_2019

The current regulations limit the taking of northern fur seals to Alaska Natives who reside on the Pribilof Islands (Pribilovians) if it is for subsistence uses and not accomplished in a wasteful manner. The regulations further limit the number of fur seals to be taken annually, and the regulations dictate the size, age, and sex of fur seals, as well as when, where, and how fur seals may be harvested. After reviewing public comments on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, NMFS will proceed with rulemaking to revise the current subsistence harvest regulations consistent with statutory obligations. Potential revisions to these regulations could include, but are not limited to a reduction in regulatory provisions and an increase in cooperative management provisions with the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island.

Currently in the Gulf of Mexico region, adding new types of sea turtle release gear to the list of approved gear in the regulations requires an amendment to the relevant Council Fishery Management Plan. This lengthy process is not conducive to promoting flexibility or the rapid adoption of new release devices within the fishery. This rule would add three newly approved sea turtle release devices to the regulations as options to fulfill the requirements for carrying sea turtle release gear. It would also modify the framework procedure to allow new types of sea turtle and other protected resources release gear and handling requirements to be approved for use without a full amendment to the fishery management plan.

Deregulatory,"In the non-pollock trawl groundfish fisheries off Alaska, there are catch limits for Pacific halibut as a prohibited species if halibut mortality reaches the limit, the fishery closes regardless of whether or not fishery participants have reached the quotas for the actual target groundfish species. This proposed action would implement catch handling and monitoring requirements to allow the sorting of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) on the deck of trawl catcher/processors and motherships participating in these fisheries. This would allow Pacific halibut to be discarded prior to entering the onboard factory, thereby reducing discard mortality. Reducing halibut discard mortality could in turn maximize harvest of the directed groundfish fisheries that otherwise might be constrained by the regulatory halibut PSC limits. To participate in halibut deck sorting, a vessel would be required to comply with additional monitoring and equipment requirements to ensure accurate accounting for halibut PSC sorted on deck. Participation in this program along with the associated costs would be voluntary, allowing for flexibility for individual vessel owners of non-pollock trawl catcher/processors and motherships to determine if the benefits of reduced halibut mortality, and the corresponding reduction in fleet-wide PSC rates, outweigh the individual costs of complying with the monitoring and enforcement requirements.",Spring_2019

The proposed amendments: correct references to power line voltage for direct current (DC) voltages as well as alternating current (AC) voltages; broadens the exclusion for forklifts carrying loads under the forks from ""winch or hook"" to with a ""winch and boom""; clarifies an exclusion for work activities by articulating cranes; provides four definitions inadvertently omitted in the final standard; replaces ""minimum approach distance"" with ""minimum clearance distance"" throughout to remove ambiguity; clarifies the use of demarcated boundaries for work near power lines; corrects an error permitting body belts to be used as a personal fall arrest system rather than a personal fall restraint system; replaces the verb ""must"" with ""may"" used in error in several provisions; corrects an error in a caption on standard hand signals; and resolves an issue of ""NRTL-approved"" safety equipment (e.g., proximity alarms and insulating devices) that is required by the final standard, but is not yet available.",Spring_2019
Regulatory,"OSHA and other U.S. agencies have been involved in a long-term project to negotiate a globally harmonized approach to classifying chemical hazards, and providing labels and safety data sheets for hazardous chemicals. The result is the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). The GHS was adopted by the United Nations, with an international goal of as many countries as possible adopting it by 2008.Â  OSHA incorporated the GHS into the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) in March 2012 to specify requirements for hazard classification and to standardize label components and information on safety data sheets, which will improve employee protection and facilitate international trade.Â  However, the GHS is a living document and has been updated several times since OSHAâ€™s rulemaking. OSHA's rulemaking was based on the third edition of the GHS and the UN recently completed the seventh.

Deregulatory,"In this proposed rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering updating the flash point test methods for the determination of characteristically ignitable hazardous waste along with other minor changes. Currently, the required test methods refer to outdated standards developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM standards) and require instrumentation that is no longer readily commercially available. For example, the standards require the use of mercury thermometers, which are becoming more difficult to acquire due to the use and availability being phased out for environmental, health and safety concerns. An update to the flash point test methods could allow for the use of commercially available instrumentation and could no longer require mercury thermometers. EPA is proposing to remove the requirements for mercury thermometers in the SW-846 air sampling and stack emissions methods. In addition, EPA is proposing to codify existing guidance regarding the regulatory exclusion in the ignitable characteristic for aqueous liquids containing alcohols and is proposing to codify existing sampling guidance regarding waste mixtures having multiple phases when determining whether a waste exhibits the ignitability characteristic.

Water, including drinking water, waste water and storm water; is handled by a system of underground pipes. Existing water pipes of all types run beneath and beside major roadways, beneath buildings and overlap other utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, cable); their replacement can potentially be problematic, especially in high-density residential, industrial and urban areas. As the infrastructure of municipalities age, utilities serving the population need to replace deteriorated water pipes. Existing water pipes can be made of various components such as clay, iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), concrete, and A/C. These A/C pipes are potentially subject to regulation under the NESHAP for Asbestos when replaced. In this final action, the EPA presents the results of our evaluation of the alternative work practice request for A/C pipe replacement subject to the Asbestos NESHAP.",Spring_2019

Â‘Â‘New microorganisms are those formed by deliberate combinations of genetic material from organisms classified in different taxonomic genera. This review process is designed to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The rule also established TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemptions from full reporting when 10 specific microorganisms are used as the recipient microorganisms for the introduced genetic material and placed requirements on these recipient microorganisms, the introduced genetic material, and the physical containment (40 CFR 725, subpart G). The rule established a mechanism (40 CFR 725.67) for the public to petition the Agency to propose additional recipient microorganisms for such exemptions. Those regulations also described the appropriate supporting information that must be submitted with the petition to provide the EPA with a starting point for determining whether the recipient should be listed as a candidate for the tiered exemption. The EPA received petitions to add Trichoderma reesei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms that may be used as recipient microorganisms in order to qualify for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms that are being manufactured (defined by statute to include import) for introduction into commerce. Based on the EPA's evaluation of these petitions, the EPA made a preliminary determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met and issued a proposed rule. After considering comments on its proposed exemption, the EPA is developing a revised proposal that will address the concerns raised by the commenters, and is considering expanding the earlier proposal to prohibit the inclusion of antibiotic resistance genes in the introduced genetic material in microorganisms qualifying for the TSCA 5(h)(4) exemption.",Spring_2019

TSCA section 6(h) directs EPA to issue regulations under section 6(a) for certain persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances that were identified in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan. This regulation must be proposed by June 22, 2019 and issued in final form no later than eighteen months after proposal. Section 6(h) further directs EPA, in selecting among the available prohibitions and other restrictions in TSCA section 6(a), to address risks of injury to health or the environment that the Administrator determines are presented by the chemical substances and reduce exposure to the chemical substances to the extent practicable. EPA must develop an exposure and use assessment, but the statute explicitly states that a risk evaluation is not required for these chemical substances. EPA has identified five chemical substances for proposed action under TSCA section 6(h). These chemical substances are: decabromodiphenyl ether; hexachlorobutadiene; pentachlorothiophenol; phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1), also known as tris(4-isopropylphenyl) phosphate; and 2,4,6-tris(tert-butyl)phenol. Decabromodiphenyl ether is a flame retardant that has been widely used in textiles, plastics, adhesives and polyurethane foam. Hexachlorobutadiene is produced as a byproduct in the production of chlorinated solvents and has also been used as an absorbent for gas impurity removal and as an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber compounds. Pentachlorothiophenol is also used in the manufacture of rubber compounds. Phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) is a flame retardant and is also used in lubricants and hydraulic fluids and in the manufacture of other compounds. 2,4,6-Tris(tert-butyl)phenol is an antioxidant that can be used as a fuel or lubricant and as an intermediate in the manufacture of other compounds.

Section 863 of the NDAA for FY 2016, Public Law 114-92, Nov. 25, 2015, establishes procedures for the publication of acquisition strategies if the acquisition involves consolidation or substantial bundling. Â This rule also addresses changes requested by industry or other agencies, including those pertaining to exclusions from calculating compliance with the limitations on subcontracting, an agencyâ€™s ability to set aside orders under set-aside contracts, and a contracting officerâ€™s authority to request reports on a prime contractorâ€™s compliance with the limitations on subcontracting. Section 2108 of Public Law 114-88 provides agencies with double credit when they award to a local small business in a disaster area.",Spring_2019
Deregulatory,"This rule will propose to remove the regulations governing Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans as a Result of the September 11, 2001, Terrorist Attacks. Pre-disaster mitigation loans were authorized by Congress in 1999 to encourage disaster preparedness rather than relying solely on response and recovery.Â  The program was authorized for 5 fiscal years (2000-2004).Â  SBA published regulations implementing the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loan program in 2002 (67 FR 62337).Â  SBA is proposing to remove these regulations, as the program is no longer authorized. In response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, SBA published regulations authorizing economic injury disaster loans outside the declared disaster areas to small businesses that suffered economic injury as a direct result of the attacks or any related federal action following the attacks. The rule, published on October 22, 2001 (66 FR 53331), outlined the eligibility criteria and loan terms. The deadline for businesses to apply for the loans was September 30, 2002.Â  SBA is proposing to remove these regulations, as they are now obsolete.",Spring_2019
Deregulatory,"In 2008, SBA ceased to certify firms as Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs). In addition, the statutory prime contract procurement preferences for SDBs were ruled to be unconstitutional in 2008 and expired in 2009. As a result, SBA seeks to remove all of its SDB certification and protest procedures. SBA would retain the SDB definition in 124.1002. Additionally, SBA seeks to remove 13 CFR 124.516 regarding resolution of disputes on 8(a) contracts because it is redundant; 13 CFR 124.512 already delegates contract administration to procuring agencies and resolving a dispute is an element of contract administration.",Spring_2019
Deregulatory,"In this interim final rule, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) adjusts all monetary based industry size standards (i.e., receipts, assets, net worth, and net income) for inflation since the last adjustment in 2014. In accordance with its regulations in 13 CFR 121.102(c), SBA is required to review the effects of inflation on its monetary standards at least once every five years and adjust them, if necessary. In addition, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Jobs Act) also requires SBA to conduct every five years a detailed review of all size standards and to make appropriate adjustments to reflect market conditions. This action will restore the small business eligibility of businesses that have lost that status due to inflation.",Spring_2019
